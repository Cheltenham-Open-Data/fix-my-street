- At around dusk on 6.30pm on 24/09/24 my front nearside tyre hit a 10 inch porhole that looked like a pool of water on B4063 heading west towards Churchdown. I stopped the car and went back to check and realised it was a pothole not a puddle. On 26/09/24 I noticed a bulge on the tyre wall so took it to Tyre City and they confirmed that it was pothole damage so I had to buy a new tyre and have the tracking adjusted, I have the invoice which I can send to you if required.ce, 23rd October :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6651567](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6651567)
