- Dear Sir/Madam I live at 24D Moorend Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham, GL53 0HD and have off road parking. The problem I have is that from the road onto to my drive way is now extremely uneven and results in the vehicles scraping the underside front and back. Can I ask if the highways Dept, or whoever is responsible for this, to come and take a look and also make repairs so that it is more even and I can park the cars onto my drive way without causing damage. It's more of a levelling requirement - From Road to pavement to my drive way., 28th February :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7205721](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7205721)
