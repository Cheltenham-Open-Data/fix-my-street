- The area's tree canopies have significantly expanded, with many lower limbs hanging at head height (the other side of the road, has recently had the tree canopies lifted), requiring pedestrians to duck to pass through unobstructed. This overgrowth not only limits visibility for pedestrians but also encroaches into the fronting gardens of nearby properties. The five tree canopies pose a particular problem as they obstruct visibility for pedestrians crossing the street, especially on the corner, and for drivers navigating along Lobley's Drive; as the lower limbs obscure important road signage, such as the 'NO HGV' sign for Lobley's Drive Bridge., 23rd July :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6265051](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6265051)
