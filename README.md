- Manhole cover in road opposite 74 Evesham Rd persistently ‘lifts’ during heavy rainfall allowing stormwater to flood the road and thereby enter the brook which is owned by the residents of the Wendlescliffe estate. This turns the brook into an erosive torrent which is doing huge and expensive damage to tge brook banks. The loose/leaking manhole cover is therefore causing damage beyond its immediate location, and causing excessive flooding to the road and adjacent driveways.There is video evidence of the faulty manhole cover whenever it rains heavily. Plus video evidence of the brook in full flow., 25th February :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7187842](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7187842)
