- Large pothole near green by garages, 11th August :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6343254](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6343254)
- A strip of road has been excavated across st George's place. Since it has been filled in, the tarmac has depressed. On one side more than the other. It has created a dip in the road for traffic moving in southerly direction onto st George's road. When a bus passes over the dip at speed i.e. when the traffic lights are green and the bus does not need to stop it thuds into the road making a noise. When a large heavy vehicle goes over the dip at speed a massive bang is felt in the building 27a St George's road. The bang is immense and the whole building feels like a car has driven into it. After the bang, the building violently shakes as if an earthquake is occuring. The council tell the public to let them know when a utility companys excavation and refill subsequently deteriorates but there is not an option here to choose. This is why I chose manhole damage. To be clear it is not a manhole., 11th August :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6342510](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6342510)
