- The pathway is uneven and damaged beyond repair, the family that live at 36 gwernant road have created their own driveway to their home over a green area. this has now left pathways impassible for other disabled residents with huge disabilities, my elderly parents live at 32 and have been there over 40 years! They also own their home, the path ways to their house are damaged beyond repair due to inconsiderate neighbours digging up the ground and creating their own drive way..my parents have been living their since 1981 and are now both disabled, the pathways surrounding the green outside there home has been left in completely unpassibke conditions for walking , even with a walking aid, how is this allowed that council Tennant's can dig up council property without consent and even if they did, what why has the green area not been turned into a parking area fit for all? My parents are stuck inside their own home in fear of falling over a path way that was fine up untill number 36 dug it up and ruined it with driving their vehicles all over the path., 22nd November :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5239667](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5239667)
