- Good afternoon, I am writing in connection with the state of (what used to be) the pavement as above, which has been cordoned off by a barrier since about July this year. This is presumably because of the instability of the wall of the property adjoining (St Ives Court) and danger to the public from falling masonry. However, no remedial action has been taken during all these months, and everyone passing is forced to walk over what used to be the grass verge, which is now reduced to soft mud. There is just as much danger from slipping on this as there is from falling masonry. The photo attached shows the state of the pavement. Either the wall needs to be repaired soonest, or the grass verge paved over to provide a safe space to walk. I’d be grateful to know what action can be taken here. As I live in Marston Road, I have no option but to use this pavement as I turn to walk south down Albert Road.
