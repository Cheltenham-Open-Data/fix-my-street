- Driving along the A435 at Bishops Cleve, heading towards Evesham, today the 28th May at 12:09, outside a small building site, there is a large sunken drain that felt on impact, felt like a loud bang as the car hit the hole at approximately 45-50mph. The sunken drain has left quite a deep hole and I think this is not only dangerous to other motorists but also cyclists and motorcyclists, as could result in the rider coming off their bike. I attempted to avoid the sunken drain but this wasnâ€™t possible due to on coming traffic and parked builders vans straddling the pavement and the road adjacent to the sunken drain., 28th May :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6031274](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6031274)
