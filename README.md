- Once again I'm complaining about disturbing noise caused by traffic driving over the drain inspection cover outside our house, 7 The Grange Reddings . This problem has been ongoing now on and off for around 15 years despite a number of unsuccessful attempts at curing the problem (the last attempt was February this year). This problem needs a permanent solution like the use of products available from https://www.noisestop.it/en/, there are probably other companies making similar products. Perhaps another solution would be to weld the two halves of the cover together & to the frame as in all the time since the manhole was installed I've never once seen it removed for maintenance., 9th May :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5953015](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5953015)
