- Drains are blocking on a regular basis with excessive water running across the road from junction of Cirencester road and road up to Birdlip (12 bells pub junction) both from the overflowing ditches from farmland and surface water running off from the side of telephone exchange. This is causing regular flooding to the road and our driveway despite me regularly clearing drains during heavy downpours., 10th February :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5558932](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5558932)
