- Road subsiding in previous patch, 15th August :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6358238](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6358238)
- Tree continuing to grow after being cut down., 14th August :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6357028](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6357028)
- Huge branches fell off tree into driveway of 17 Keynsham Road. Damaged fence between no. 17 and no. 15. Luckily no vehicles on drive and no one passing. I have reported this tree twice already since Xmas when a falling branch from the same tree wrote my car off, the week after a larger branch fell and almost hit a traffic warden. Someone is going to get killed if this tree is not properly maintained. We can see a number of dead branches, one of which is now on the ground. Please will someone take this seriously?, 14th August :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6356989](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6356989)
