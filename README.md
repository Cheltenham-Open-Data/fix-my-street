- The vacuum tanker team worked on several drains in Royal Well Lane on 2nd October. On 3rd of October 3 out of 6 drains I looked at were still blocked. I measured the levels of all 7. 4 drains were 40+ inches to the water level, 1 at 25 inches, 1 at 17 inches and 1 at 11 inches. Today's observations show minimal change if any. Well and truly blocked I think. Vacuum Tanker not able to lift compacted stuff? Needs high pressure or digging out?, 4th October :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6552347](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6552347)
