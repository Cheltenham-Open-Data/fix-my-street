- Multiple potholes for years. Generally just a very bad part of Grafton Road. Rather than just keep "patching up" the road it would make more financial sense to completely resurface it. The double yellow lines could also do with painting again. The rest of Grafton road is lovely but the area off the Bath road reallyblets it down!!, 8th April :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5825951](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5825951)
