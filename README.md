- I would like to bring to your attention a safety concern related to the Southam Lane bus stop, which is frequently used by GE Aerospace employees. I inadvertently reported this issue under the incorrect section labeled "Traffic Lights," and I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. As a regular user of bus D from the Southam Lane stop, I have observed that crossing the road at this point poses significant risks. There is currently no pedestrian traffic light at this intersection, requiring pedestrians to watch for vehicles coming from three different directions. Furthermore, there are two traffic lights for cars in opposing lanes, which adds to the confusion from a pedestrian standpoint. I have witnessed instances where vehicles have disregarded the red light, creating a hazardous situation for those crossing the road. The potential for a serious accident is a genuine concern, especially since this crossing is heavily utilized by fellow employees. I strongly recommend the installation of a dedicated pedestrian traffic light and overall improvements to the crossing to enhance pedestrian safety. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Elif, 29th January :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7055456](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7055456)
