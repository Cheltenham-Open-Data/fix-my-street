- Stream at the side of the pavement. The bank and grass verge has been completely eroded by water. The underside of the pavement is starting to wash away outside Spring Cotrage, New Road, Southam, Cheltenham, GL52 3NX. Highways put in flagstones at the side of the stream at the next property down (Evolene), but would not deal with the bank at the properties either side Spring Cottage above and Willow Cottage below. Several sections of bank have fallen into the stream outside Willow Cottage and debris from upstream is raising the bottom stream. This is likely to overflow in very wet weather and run into the road. Needs attention before poor winter weather., 15th November :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6746464](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6746464)
