- Driving along the A435 at Bishops Cleve, heading towards Evesham, today the 28th May at 12:09, outside a small building site, there is a large sunken drain that felt on impact, felt like a loud bang as the car hit the hole at approximately 45-50mph. The sunken drain has left quite a deep hole and I think this is not only dangerous to other motorists but also cyclists and motorcyclists, as could result in the rider coming off their bike. I attempted to avoid the sunken drain but this wasn’t possible due to on coming traffic and parked builders vans straddling the pavement and the road adjacent to the sunken drain., 28th May :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6031274](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6031274)
