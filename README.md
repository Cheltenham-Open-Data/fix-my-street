- This road is in an absolutely deplorable state and given the location of the school it is really dangerous, 27th January :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499590](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499590)

- Just off the main Cotswold Way (OS Explorer map 179 at approx grid ref 133194) as you turn eastwards off the path and diagonally upwards on another main path towards a private house/track and a Gloucestershire Wildlife information board about Buckholt Wood a couple of hundred metres away. A very large tree (requires a chainsaw, tree is several feet in circumference and about 40 ft high) has fallen and completely blocked the path. It is not possible to go round the blocked path as the tree is so large it continues to block the path for many many metres on either side. You have to be able to climb over not only the tree trunk but also a mass of branches blocking the path to a height of a couple of feet. Most walkers will find it simply impossible to get by., 27th January :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499113](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499113)
