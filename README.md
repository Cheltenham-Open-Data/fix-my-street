- Currently part of Green street is closed off. I don’t know by who. On some website I’ve found it says that a permit has been granted for this. And same website says that road will be closed until 18/9/24. I think it’s quite possible there will be a road traffic accident as a result of this road closure and subsequent diversion. Hopefully I won’t be a victim in this. I’d be grateful if you could tell me what you’re going to do about this., 13th September :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6467851](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6467851)
