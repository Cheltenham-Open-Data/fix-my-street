- On the Hucclecote Road, travelling towards Gloucester, but before the M5 bridge. It is beyond the turning to Bird Road and yes it has painted lines but I am fed up with trying to report this problem. I must inform you that having told you of this problem if I hear or learn of a cyclist being involved in an accident at this point I will report you to the relevant authorities. This is a very dangerous pothole for cyclists of which I am one. Finally this website is so difficult to use and as I type out this message I can only see the last few words which again is indicative of a poorly designed website . If you wish to call me to discuss this my telephone number is (01452) 611614., 10th January :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5425788](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5425788)

- The highway is directly up against the foundations of an exsisting Cotswold Boundry wall of a property Shepherds Cottage. The surface of the highway has been eroded by the constant flow of storm water along the surfaces. A repair is urgently required as it is undermining the foundation of the boundary wall which could cause it to collapse. Highways own the road up to the boundary wall - there is no verge., 10th January :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5422872](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5422872)
