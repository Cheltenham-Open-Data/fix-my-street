- Street needs cleaning of leaves. The parking lines are not visible, it is incredibly slippy and become a thick mulch and with any rain all these leaves will go into the drains potentially blocking them., 27th November :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6792145](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6792145)
- Drain cover is sunken at lights - there was a cone there presumably to fix it but its now been there for over a month. The cone is now on side of road with a roadworks sign leaning up nowhere near the actual problem.
