- There is a sunken drain cover in the northbound carriageway. It has been previously reported in November 2023 under Web Reference: 5212149 Enquiry Number: 22034128, and again in June 2024 under reference FixMyStreet ref: 6109829. It appears to have not been fixed, or at least any repair previously made was not long lasting. Would suggest it needs digging out, the edge reinforcing, and then the drain cover being put back so that it is flush with the surface of the road. Please could this be attended to as it presents a danger/risk of damage to car tyres/suspensions or worse still for cyclists etc., 25th November :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6783683](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6783683)
