- Streetlights have not worked between the main entrance (3) of the university and going towards the moorend roundabout. It is pitch black, dangerous to pedestrians, joggers and cyclists. As a woman who has to walk my dog before work early in the morning I feel very vulnerable as it is so dark. The lights have been out for at least 3 weeks.
