- This Public Right of Way has been in use for at least 90 years and leads from the top of Corndean Lane down past Wadfield Farm. About three years ago the landowner did various unofficial works to this path including installing a cattle grid. This makes it impossible to use the ROW safely. There is no gate beside it to keep the path open and accessible. The landowner has created his own unofficial 'permissive path' on which there was no public consultation. This path is not only overgrown but also has barbed wire at a low level which could harm a child. There should be a pedestrian gate beside the cattle grid so the original ROW down the lane can be accessed safely. The ROW sign was moved by the landowner then moved again by GCC, but it was located not beside the ROW but halfway between the actual ROW and the landowner's 'permissive path.' It should be pointing down the lane towards the cattle grid as it was before the landowner moved it., 3rd October :- [https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6549104](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6549104)
