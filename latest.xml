<title>Missing road markings, 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5579055</link>
<description>Following the recent resurfacing of a road section. The road markings have not been applied and are missing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 133, Alstone Lane, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5579055&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Old Bath Road, northbound on mini-roundabout, immediately by Sandford Road eastbound exit., 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578989</link>
<description>Potholes between the roundabout white disc marking and the Sandford Road &amp;#39;give way&amp;#39; line. As northbound vehicles take the right-hand bend at this point, potholes cause bad jarring which affects roadholding. At most hours of the day it is impossible to swerve around them by driving straight across the humped white disc which is a discomfort in itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Recent work was done to repair potholes in the southbound carriageway just feet away and it&amp;#39;s bizarre that the worst northbound potholes weren&amp;#39;t dealt with at the same time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks in advance&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sandford Road, Tivoli, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578989&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Harp Hill; Multiple potholes, especially between Battledown Families Centre and junction with Camp Road, 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578978</link>
<description>Too many individual failures to list separately. They have been present and worsening for years.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vehicles need extra traction to hold the road because of curvature and steep gradient, but handling my car safely up and down Harp Hill (which I use almost every day) has become extremely challenging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During most hours of the day, oncoming traffic prevents swerving to avoid the worst potholes but some motorists still attempt to do this causing me to brake sharply. The few remedial repairs done in recent years haven&amp;#39;t lasted. Traffic is increasing because of new development.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some trenches dug in Harp Hill by utility companies have not been properly made good afterwards and can cause &amp;#39;tramlining&amp;#39;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If these defects are not attended to, or better still the whole road resurfaced as well as you&amp;#39;ve recently done in St. Pauls Road and Pittville Circus, Harp Hill will become unsafe very soon and it needs to be prioritised.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks in advance&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stanley Road, Battledown, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578978&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
