<title>Enquiry Number: 22042747, 6th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5677629</link>
<description>Web Reference: 5661967 Enquiry Number: 22042747 Issue: Pothole on the Pavement Location: On the right hand side of pavement of Christchurch road when facing Christ Churchbetween Well Place and Malvern Road. This is a very busy pavement and is extremely dangerous as can be seen via the photos. Site: CHRISTCHURCH ROAD&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The repair has now been completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who-ever has reported back to you that this work has been completed is lying. I have just completed my walk past this area and there is no evidence of any work having taken place what so ever. The pavement is exactly as per the photos I filed with yourselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please ensure that the work order is reinstate and hopefully it shall be done this time – properly! This is a pavement that school children use every day to walk from their boarding houses to the main school and should not be left in such a poor condition.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Christchurch Road, Lansdown, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5677629&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fence being put up on grass verge, 6th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5676988</link>
<description>Lower Farm Upper Coberley, GL53 9RD The owner of Lower Farm is putting up a fence along the grass verge to the road - as far as I am aware this is not her land, the boundary is her wall and grass is council owned land - please advise? The fence will stop cars from avoiding any oncoming traffic, dogs and dog walkers, horses and children as the owner of Lower Farm has already created a blind spot on a dangerous bend by growing foliage out into the road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5676988.0.jpeg?7700cb82&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5676988&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
