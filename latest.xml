<description>The vegetation has overgrown the footpath on the racecourse hill such that part of the footpath have only 60cm width for pedestrians. If someone is walking down the hill and a large vehicle is driving down the road close to the footpath there is a danger that their mirrors will overhang the footpath and could hit the pedestrian, with the possibility of serious injury, as they will not observe the vehicle. The vegetation needs cleared back to widen the footpath.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Evesham Road, Swindon, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5136924&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 25th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5136448</link>
<description>The tree above is now VERY large and tall. The leaves and branches fall on to the pavement and road which can be very dangerous in wet and icy conditions.Due to the new housing estate the path is now very busy. A neighbour and I try to keep the path clear by picking up the debris. &amp;#10;The tree was Polled about 5 years ago but nothing since so it is now very big and also covers the street light. &amp;#10;Would be grateful if you could see what could be done to ensure safety and also looks very untidy.&amp;#10;The tree is a eucalyptus willow which at times the leaves give off a sticky substance which sticks to cars and very difficult to remove.&amp;#10;Please could you see what you can do about this issue.&amp;#10;Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5136448&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 25th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5135782</link>
<description>email rcvd 24.10.23 - Hello,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to let you know that there is a very nasty pothole posing serious danger to cyclists on A40 westbound, opposite Balcarras Farm. It is deep, narrow and sharp, plus very hard to see.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I was cycling home on Sunday 15th October. A string of cars was passing and I could not deviate, consequently I hit the pothole which caused an immediate pinch flat in the tyre (not inner tube). I was very lucky not to come off the bike as the cars were passing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The whole length of the A40 in Charlton Kings is in terrible condition in both directions and eventually there will be a serious accident involving cyclists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I attach photos of the pothole and invoice for the repair to the tyre.The wheel is also damaged but remains usable, despite the cosmetic appearance (a shame since it is an expensive, new bike). I would kindly ask that;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. urgent attention is given to the road surface repair&amp;#10;2. you consider compensation for the damage to my bike (invoice attached)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5135782&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
