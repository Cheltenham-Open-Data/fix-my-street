<title>A Sign/waymaker is misleading problem has been found, 11th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5084811</link>
<description>A Sign/waymaker is misleading problem has been found by Gloucestershire County Council, Dear Sir Can you tell me whether a footpath diversion I encountered was official? This was off Crippetts Lane having come down from Crickley Hill. At 936185 I encountered a sign saying &amp;quot;stags can be dangerous please use alternative path&amp;quot;. The 6 foot high gates on the original path were locked. I worked out where it was intended I should go and discovered there were some yellow arrow footpath signs further along.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Crippetts Lane, Leckhampton, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5084811&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bordered up at the eastern end of the footpath, 10th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5081823</link>
<description>I have a query about Cheltenham Footpath 1. I noticed this footpath was bordered up at the eastern end of the footpath along Old Gloucester Road. It also seems inaccessible along the field boundary that runs west along adjacent allotments. On the online PROW map it does not say the path is closed, so I am wondering if it is in fact closed and what it says on the definitive map.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Gloucester Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5081823&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
