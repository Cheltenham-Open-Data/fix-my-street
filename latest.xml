<title>Poor junction design Gotherington Lane, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5447819</link>
<description>A new junction on Gotherington Lane approaching the shops and the Black Gold Cafe is very poorly designed, confusing and will lead to accidents. It is wholly unclear who has right of way or when/how to signal to indicate you are crossing or turning at the junction. When the road exiting the newest development is open, it will become potentially very dangerous and an accident black spot. Gotherington Lane was previously a straight road and usual Highway Code rules were simple to apply. The layout of the junction is needs to be changed rapidly.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1,2,3,4,5,6, Oldacre Drive, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5447819&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Poor road design Gotherington Lane, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5447763</link>
<description>There are 2 chicanes on a dangerous bend along Gotherington Lane that force drivers into the middle of the road and visibility is limited because of the bends and narrowness of the road. An accident here is inevitable. Additionally, an exit road is planned from the newest development that exits onto the same bend. This has potential to become a highly dangerous junction.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gotherington Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5447763&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The bridge balustrade across the River Churn, at the lowest point of the road below the Green Dragon Pub was damaged in the middle of last year. Temporary orange barriers were erected but no proper repair has been undertaken. There is no outstanding marker shown on &amp;#39;Fix my Street&amp;#39; so I am reporting this again.

<title>Chicanes on dangerous bend and road egress in the middle of those dangerous bends., 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5446256</link>
<description>The 2 serious bends near Homelands Farm are now marked with chicanes. These bring each direction into the middle of the road and, because of the bends, it takes a while to return to the correct side of the road - without making sharp manoeuvres. This problem will be further exacerbated as there appears to be a planned egress from new build right in the middle of those bends. How dangerous is that?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gotherington Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5446256&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bubb&#39;s Hill - Numerous deep trenches at edge of road, 15th January</title>

<description>There are numerous deep trenches up Bubb&amp;#39;s Hill where the verge has washed away and left trenches -some over 150mm deep. A number of vehicles have gone down these trenches. The location on the map indicates where some but not all of the trenches are.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5446231.0.jpeg?f9c2e6d8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Elkstone, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5446231&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Confusing road markings/right of way?, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5446174</link>
<description>The new road markings and right of way in Gotherington Lane, where the shops are. I use this road regularly and cannot understand the markings or who has right of way. The direct route through Gotherington Lane appears to have been changed in favour of some peculiar arrangement. No-one understands what they are expected to do or what signals to give. This is a serious accident waiting to happen and should be changed sooner rather than later. I have often met 3 cars from different directions and all stay still waiting to see what happens next. No-one I speak to understands the set up.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1,2,3,4,5,6, Oldacre Drive, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5446174&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Leaves on Cycle lan, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5445772</link>
<description>The new cycle lane going up the hill has already been covered in leaves from the trees in Autumn. The leaves are in large piles, just from being washed down hill in the rains, but the piles are too large for a Road bike to get over them, they would have to slalom their way between the piles. This has been an issue since shortly after the road was reopened with the brand new cycle lane created last year (Sept 2023). There should be a regular leaf cleaner sent up the cycle lan to keep it tidy and safe for use.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cirencester Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5445772&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Eight Street Lights out for a month, 15th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5445090</link>
<description>This block of eight street lights affect Notgrove Close, the east end of Bibury Road, east end of Farmington Road and the footpath that crosses Benhall Park, Cheltenham. This was first reported on 16 December and several times since but nothing appears to have happened and we have received no updates. The photograph indicates what pedestrians are faced with after dark on Bibury Road alone. I have seen elderly people leaving the bus stop (under the nearest lamp) miss-step from the high curb trying to cross the road in total darkness and other pedestrians blinded by car headlights trying to remain on the footpath. Someone needs to pull their finger out before this reaches Gloucestershire Live and beyond.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5445090.0.jpeg?4c0b396c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 38, Bibury Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5445090&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
