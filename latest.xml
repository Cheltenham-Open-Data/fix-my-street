<title>Several deep and dangerous pot holes on Linworth Road, Bishops Cleeve, Gl528PB., 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4115266</link>
<description>Several deep and dangerous pot holes outside no. 2 to approx no. 10 Linworth Road, Bishops Cleeve, Gl528PB. They have been there for months. They have been filled in with gravel at some point and the gravel is all over the road flicking up and hitting vehicles as they go by. Itâ€™s a highly used road with many buses and trade vans.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4115266.0.jpeg?db75ce45&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Two Hedges Road, Woodmancote&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4115266&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Potholes across Road, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4108680</link>
<description>The location is the Cleeve Common Road just past the entrance to the Old Quarry / Dry Pool Farm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two potholes have opened up - one either side of the road and right in the vehicle wheel tracks such that it is impossible to miss them. The road between the potholes also seems to be braking up to form a shallow &amp;#39;trench&amp;#39;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can these be filled in such that it stops the holes reopening as quite a few vehicles use this road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Cleeve Common, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4108680&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>2 large pot holes, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4107870</link>
<description>Large pot holes outside number 6 and number 8 Linworth Road. The holes are that deep there is a lot of debris left over the road which keeps hitting our vehicles. These have been there since before Christmas but everytime they are filled they come out a few weeks later. This is by a school so the traffic is really bad and is causing a lot of damage now. We shouldnâ€™t have to keep sweeping the pavement/road everyday. The road is bad and then flicks the stones up at my car and then it covered the pavement which is going to do a school child an injury sooner or later. Please sort&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 8 Linworth Road, Bishops Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4107870&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
