<title>Drainage from front of 77 causing pavement to disintegrate and floor, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5520192</link>
<description>There is no drainage channel in the pavement at the front of 77. The rainwater downpipe is starting to cause the pavement to deteriorate. In heavy rain, water pools in this area and doesn&amp;#39;t drain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other houses on Rosehill St. have a concrete drainage channel installed (photos attached) to mitigate this issue. Can a similar system be installed here?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5520192.0.jpeg?7af5f2c2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 79, Rosehill Street, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5520192&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Collapsed verges, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5519702</link>
<description>There are a number of collapsed verges along the stretch from the top of Wistley Hill to the Kilkenny. Vehicles have come off the road causing them and yet they&amp;#39;ve never been filled leaving long ditches in places. There is even a new area that has been ploughed up and as such the white road markings are hidden in places. All of these areas need filling as this is a dangerous road at the best of times. I should also like to highlight that Highways fail to ever collect signage and especially cones along this road. Many cones litter it and have done for many months, years in one spot which quite frankly is a disgrace seeing as they cost the taxpayer money and they also look unsightly. How can we ever expect humans to stop littering if highways themselves do it ?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Dowdeswell, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5519702&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A series of holes, uneven and damaged road surface for approximately 300m, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5519441</link>
<description>The condition of the Rowanfield Road surface has been in decline since I first began living here in 2013. There have been a number of pot holes that have appeared over the years that have eventually been filled in, but to a standard where they deteriorate and remerge again later. The result is that the overall surface is very rough and uneven for several hundred meters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I suffered a severe back injury in 2014 which still causes me problems today, and when turning into Rowanfield Road from Libertus Road in order to drive home I have to avoid exceeding 15mph in order to avoid painful jolts to my back, irrespective of what car I am travelling in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This has been compounded by the fact that heavy goods vehicles are regularly using this road despite a sign at the entrance to Rowanfield Road at the Libertus Road end stating that it is unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles. This regulation needs to be more strictly enforced so that HGVs are required to use the Alstone Lane end to access the trading estates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have been a regular homeworker since 2017 and despite my house being newly-built with a strong concrete structure in 2011 and my office being at the back of the house, passing HGVs cause the house to shake, as well as inevitably contributing to the damaged surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rowanfield Road is a high traffic road despite being residential, yet has not been properly resurfaced in over a decade, despite many roads in the surrounding area having been resurfaced.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 102, Rowanfield Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5519441&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
