<description>The drain cover is directly outside of 193 Swindon Road. It&amp;#39;s making a terrible clunking noise every time a car drives over it.

<title>Over 30 cans thrown in hedgerow, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5430102</link>
<description>I have undertaken regular litter picking in Shaw Green Lane for many years and I have noticed in the last year that someone is regularly drinking alcohol at the quieter end of the road and throwing their cans into the hedgerow. I collected over 30 cans today, and there affre many more that I can&amp;#39;t get to. I was wondering if some signage could go up to try and deter them, such as &amp;#39;we are watching you&amp;#39; or a littering penalty notice.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shaw Green Lane, Prestbury, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5430102&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5428941</link>
<description>email rcvd 09.01.24 - Dear Sir,&amp;#10;A few months ago, you cut down a dead tree which had been growing in the grass verge outside my house.&amp;#10;You left a stump about three feet tall quoting &amp;#39;health and safety&amp;#39;. I understood that you were going to grind it out.&amp;#10;Since I keep stumbling into it in the dark, I hope that you could &amp;#39;grind it out&amp;#39; soon. The question arises about a replacement tree. When and what sort of tree will you put there. We would NOT LIKE a Flowering Cherry out side the house for example. &amp;#10;If we, (wife and I), have an input about a replacement tree, we would like sometyhing MORE substantial and we would LOOK AFTER IT in subsequent years,(watering), etc.&amp;#10;When can we hope for a replacement?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5428941&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5427677</link>
<description>email rcvd 09.01.24 - I hit a very large pothole which immediately caused my tyre to deflate. The pot hole can be seen in the photos attached and is around two metres long and around 250mm deep in places.  When I inspected the pothole closely, I could see it was one of the worst I had seen.  There was a feint line around part of it, which could not be seen at night, especially during the rain with the road water logged.&amp;#10; &amp;#10;The pothole could easily have caused an accident, especially for cyclists or motorcyclists and needs urgent rectification.&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5427677&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
