<title>Damaged keep left sign, 20th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5235057</link>
<description>This damaged sign has had a temporary alternative placed in front of it. I know it has been like that for 2 years, as my son repositioned the temporary sign when it was blown over in the wind before Christmas 2021!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;High time that Glos County Council sorted this out permanently, as it is an eyesore in a Conservation area.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5235057.0.jpeg?a5a3d26b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): The Park, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5235057&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Area of road surface has sunk across full width of Coberley Road, 20th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5233580</link>
<description>Directly opposite the road entrance to Old Dowmans Farm an area approximately 60cm wide running across the full width of the carriageway on Coberley Road has sunk as the result of the installation of a service pipe under the main road. The installation of the pipe was performed in 2021 or earlier, and the surface of the road above this has been gradually sinking ever since. It is now at a depth that causes a significant hazard to traffic travelling across it and results in great difficulty for vehicles to safely turn into Old Dowmans Farm. The sunken area fills with rainwater frequently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5233580.0.jpeg?df336e96&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Main Street, Coberley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5233580&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Worst bit of road in Cheltenham, 20th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5232628</link>
<description>The stretch of road from the T junction by the nursery, up to the top of the S curve is honestly a shamble. You have filled in the potholes with temporary surfaces which erode away by nightfall. Everytime I drive on this bit of road (I.e. twice a day), I pray that my poor old car doesn&amp;#39;t break. I&amp;#39;m skint and I can afford to repair something if it breaks due to this shocking bit of road. It would be smoother to drive across a ploughed field. Please sort this out, we pay taxes and get to enjoy roads which have been left to ruin since their creation... where is my money going???&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hayden Road, Springbank, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5232628&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Yet more potholes, 20th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5232423</link>
<description>Yet again, directly outside my home, 17 Cromwell Road, more potholes have developed. Yet again these are causing a large amount of stones to build up on the edge of the road which are catapulted onto my property, and cars causing DAMAGE. I also have to drive directly over the holes when reversing into my drive. Why on earth can&amp;#39;t you just repair the defects properly and fully? Would this not be a better use of public funds than having to attend over and over and over again? The situation is not helped by enormous regular lorries from Mira which literally shake my entire house. I imagine these also cause or aggravate the already poorly maintained road. The size of these numerous holes is increasing on a daily basis. They need fixing now. And when you do, please do NOT leave a load of stones on the road, as you did last time. I had to clear these all up myself. They are a hazard.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 19, Cromwell Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5232423&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
