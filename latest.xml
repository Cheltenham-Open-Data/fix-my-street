<title>Road Markings almost invisible in wet weather, 12th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5312260</link>
<description>The entire road between Prestbury and Southam has very poor road markings. This is extremely dangerous this time of year as I see drivers struggling to see the lines and will slow down when oncoming traffic is approaching. When wet, the markings are almost invisible in the glare.It would also be great if they could be parked at the edges of the road as the curbs are also difficult to see.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): B4632, Southam, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5312260&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Telecoms/utilities box covered in graffiti, 12th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5311796</link>
<description>The telecoms/utilities boxes on London Rd by the alley to Upper Park Street (opposite Sandford Mill Road junction) is covered in graffiti. London Road is a very busy road so it is seen by many people daily and doesn&amp;#39;t give a good impression of the town. It would be great if it could be cleaned off/painted over. There is also graffiti on the wall in the alley but this isn&amp;#39;t visible from the road only to people walking through the alley.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5311796.0.jpeg?6bb8e83d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 136, London Road, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5311796&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
