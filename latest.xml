<title>Junction 11A Northbound, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7108450</link>
<description>Is there any reason why there’s no direct access to the M5 northbound at this junction without diverting all the way to the A46 roundabout and coming back on myself every time, which is an unnecessary waste of time and fuel. At the Brockworth interchange roundabout this could be resolved by incorporating a left turn from B4641 onto the a417, which at present means you can only take the slip road off this Dual Carriageway, but not onto it. This issue doesn’t exist on the southbound however as there’s direct access Both on and off the M5. Coming off the Northbound it’s exactly the same, going all the way back on myself around the A46 roundabout. Why doesn’t the hard left turn coming off the M5 merge, at least partially, with the one coming off the southbound, considering both are duel lane roads, and thus would be feasible without disrupting the A417 traffic flow&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockworth Interchange, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7108450&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Verges badly damaged on Evesham Road between Race Course Roundabout and West Approach Drive, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7108333</link>
<description>Dear Sir/Madam&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Should you not already be aware of the situation, I wish to draw to your attention to the appalling state of some of the verges in Evesham Road. They have deteriorated rapidly since the completion of the cycle path at the beginning of this year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It seems that the width of the Evesham Road was reduced too much in certain areas, causing serious problems for extra-large vehicles as they try and pass by each other whilst travelling in opposite directions. Such vehicles have been mounting the kerb, in several locations, and their tyres have been ploughing through the grass verges, leaving a trail of deep scars of mud and destruction. I fear that it may only be a matter of time before a vehicle mounts the curb, onto the verge and collides with a pedestrian.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The newly altered junctions of roads, such as Cleevelands Drive and Albermarle Gate which lead into and from Evesham Road do not allow extra-large vehicles enough turning space and these vehicles inevitably have to cut the relevant corner to complete their turn. As a consequence, the verges are regularly being driven over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The attached photos were taken during the first week of February 2025, between the Race Course Roundabout and the turning into Albermarle Gate, and show the devastation caused to the verges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not only does it look unsightly, but the earth/mud dislodged from the verges is often thrown onto the pedestrian pathways, making them difficult, dirty and sometimes dangerous to walk over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The present situation needs immediate attention and I request your comments in this respect. Yours faithfully&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Michael Foster Tel. 07474574669&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7108333.0.jpeg?5b79d067&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Evesham Road, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7108333&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Planted tree growing across footpath, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7108203</link>
<description>At top of Public footpath running alongside Chase Avenue towards Ham. A tree was planted a few years ago (possibly 6/7 years) which was planted directly on the footpath - we are not sure who planted the tree. As the tree has grown the roots are spreading across the footpath affecting a nearby wall and may be affecting a nearby drain.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7108203.0.jpeg?39410c1e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 364, London Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7108203&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement leading onto newly created rear parking space, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7107803</link>
<description>Where builders have for months been placing large skips/lorries for clearance/redoing a garden the pavement has been badly damaged. The dips and undulations make it very difficult for anyone not in good health to walk safely on the pavement. This sort of damage has been done to many of the pavements around this area, particularly Everest Rd. The parking place which has been created for the back entrance of the property whose front is on Old Bath Road, has already been used without a dropped kerb permit being applied for and a dropped kerb being put in place. That means that the 4x4 which has been parked there has &amp;#39;bumped&amp;#39; up the pavement which will inevitably further damage the pavement. All the builders seem to have immunity from prosecution for creating damage to public property in the form of pavements.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 54, Westbury Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7107803&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
