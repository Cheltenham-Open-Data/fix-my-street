<title>Drains on balcarras lane are blocked, 18th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5334629</link>
<description>Rainwater flows down the lane towards East End Road. It is obvious that the run-off from the hills does not adequately drain into any ditch and because the storm drains appear permanently blocked with mud and leaves, this frequently results in a mini-river flowing down towards the school, which then pools into a small pond at the end, by the junction with East End Road. If the weather is freezing in the winter this flood water on the lane can turn into ice, which is particularly hazardous.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Balcarras Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5334629&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ambiguous and confusing lane marking. Inconsistent with Highway Code. Hazardous for cyclists in particular., 18th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5334536</link>
<description>Road markings on Hatherley Lane travelling from A40 roundabout towards B&amp;amp;Q roundabout are ambiguous, and I would contend are dangerously so, leading to potential accidents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both lanes currently have straight ahead arrows painted but this makes no sense and is hard to reconcile against Highway Code guidance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have experienced numerous near misses in a car, and more than one near collision when I&amp;#39;ve been on a bicycle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shouldn&amp;#39;t the right hand lane be designated for vehicles travelling to Grovefield Way, or the Park &amp;amp; Ride? And left hand lane designated for Hatherley Lane or the B&amp;amp;Q estate?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hatherley Lane, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5334536&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>I lost my wheel, 18th December</title>

<description>I stopped in the location (Three letter word GPS location) &amp;quot;catapult.nerd.keener&amp;quot; which was about 20 seconds from the pothole (I was driving to the north on the road), it was the nearest safe place to park, though still caused traffic obstruction. I did not dare walking to the pothole because it was unsafe. There was another car broken on the road because of another pothole&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5334115.0.jpeg?3395f49a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Elkstone, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5334115&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
