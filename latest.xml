<title>Hole in verge and poor repair, 16th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7141807</link>
<description>Please see attached photos. I have been trying to resolve this problem and have used Fix My Street several times but keep having to open new issues as there is no way to have a conversation. A hole in the verge has been identified by Highways as requiring filling outside 60 Beeches Road, Charlton Kings. For some reason a pile of mud has been dumped by Highways and has created a huge mess on the pavement, obstruction to pedestrians, and clearly has made the original issue worse not better. This cannot be left as it is as you can see from the photos. This was caused by Highways and so Highways need to resolve it. I have been told that the drop kerb cannot be moved due to proximity to lighting. There is no lighting nearby! I have been told that the grass cannot be tarmac’d. clearly it can, as one has been done a few houses away (see photos). I have been told the drop kerb is to protect the drain. Again, see photos from a house a few doors away where the drain is within the entrance of the drop kerb. In summary: Highways have clearly identified a problem but their efforts to resolve the problem have made matters far worse. This is causing issues to people using my house and pedestrians walking past. The issue needs to be made better and not worse(as it has to date) by Highways. I would welcome an opportunity to discuss rather than having to keep filing Fix My Street reports.
