<title>A pothole in road problem, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5206565</link>
<description>email rcvd 10.11.23 - Please send me the claims procedure for damage to vehicles. &amp;#10;Yesterday I had an incident resulting in a bicycle flat tyre. The expense will be low, but I&amp;#39;d like to claim for the tyre tube cost and possible repair costs. I have a video recording of the incident and, from information available, it appears GCC have failed to inspect and maintain the road sufficiently and/or adequately repair damage to the road.&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5206565&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Streetlight too bright outside house, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5205258</link>
<description>27 Gloucester Street, winchcombe. The street light that is attached to the side of my house is unbearably bright. It floods my upstairs bedroom with bright light at night that can not be blocked out with blinds. Please can you fit a black shield to the light to prevent the light flooding in. This has been an issue since all the street lights were changed to ultra bright LED. I have tried multiple ways to block it out but nothing works. I have seen that other houses have had the dark shield fitted on Gloucester Street and would like one too.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 23, Gloucester Street, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5205258&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>email rcvd 10.11.23 - The road surface outside 163 Hewlett Road is disintegrating as predicted due to previous inadequate repairs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The previous 3 or 4 visits by your contractor&amp;#39;s have failed to repair the damage, the anticipated repairs did not happen in July.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It requires yet another visit for rectification work, I would ask that you monitor the contractors closely on this repair to ensure that it is completed properly this time, a repair like this should not require multiple visits to repair at public expense.&amp;#10;The history of this particular pothole are in this email thread. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have previously raised concerns about the management and control of contractors by GCC, the Zone 15 fiasco support these concerns. &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5205549&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
