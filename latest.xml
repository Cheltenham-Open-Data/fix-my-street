<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7317597</link>
<description>This has been repaired 2 or 3 times and has collapsed again. It has been coned off for 2 weeks but is creating a hazard as it narrows road from 2 lanes to 1 and a half immediately after the traffic lights. Needs repairing properly please&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A435, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7317597&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Removed tree, 21st March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7317336</link>
<description>This tree has been chopped down to half height. Are you going to replace it? Why is the council committed to planting more trees and yet at the same time cutting others down and leaving half a trunk? Is wrapping it in hazard tape a long term solution?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 41, Alstone Croft, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7317336&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ambiguous road markings leading up to roundabout, 21st March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7317312</link>
<description>The lane markings leading up to the roundabout serving Park and Ride, B&amp;amp;Q, and Hatherley Road and Hatherley Lane are ambiguous. They used to show park and ride for right hand lane, but this has been marked over. Now you get people using both lanes to go towards Grovefield Way. This is dangerous and confusing. Please mark the two lanes accordingly as required to remove all doubt going forward. This was reported previously but you seem to have deleted it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hatherley Lane, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7317312&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unpermitted roadworks problem, 21st March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7315973</link>
<description>Email received 20/03/2025 - copy attached:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dear Sir/Madam, &amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to express my concerns regarding the temporary roadworks on the A46 Painswick road near the Coopers Hill junction, which I encountered yesterday afternoon at approximately 12:30 PM.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While cycling uphill through the roadworks, after waiting for the traffic lights to change, I was subjected to unprofessional and potentially dangerous behaviour by two of the operatives. Midway through the roadworks, I was waved at and shouted at, with one operative demanding I &amp;quot;get off the road to allow cars to pass before the lights change.&amp;quot; I responded saying it was not my fault and continued cycling. &amp;#10;The right-hand carriageway was coned off, indicating it was unsafe for travel, and the presence of machinery and operatives further precluded its use.&amp;#10;Before reaching the end of the roadworks, the oncoming traffic lights turned green, resulting in vehicles attempting to overtake me in an extremely narrow space, creating a hazardous situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I found the manner in which I was addressed to be exceptionally rude. I object strongly to being shouted at and ordered to &amp;quot;get off the road.&amp;quot; The fundamental problem lies with the inadequate timing of the temporary traffic lights, which are under the control of the operatives. Surely there is an obligation to ensure the safe passage of all road users. I question whether the operatives would have displayed the same behaviour towards other similar road users, such as farm vehicles, delivery vehicles, or equestrians, who also frequently use this route.&amp;#10;The conduct of the operatives reflected poorly on both themselves and the company they represent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I ask you to address this matter to improve the safety and experience of all road users navigating roadworks. I trust you will take my concerns seriously and implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Regards,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7315973&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
