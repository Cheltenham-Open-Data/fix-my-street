<title>Industrial Estate not signposted, 20th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5342541</link>
<description>The problem I am contacting you about is caused due to the nearby Brookfield Farm Industrial Estate on Gravel Pit Lane, which has been growing over the last few years, having same postcode as The Hayes, Southam Road, GL52 3NQ, but there is no signage on Southam Road for the Ind Estate. So we are now getting a lot of HGVs including huge articulated lorries erroneously driving onto our private driveway which is not built to accommodate these vehicles - they have done damage to the grass verges and taken large branches off mature, protected trees in their endeavour to navigate their way in, only to have to reverse out again onto the busy Southam Road once they realise they are in the wrong place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Signage is needed for the Industrial Estate on the Southam Road for HGVs coming from both directions at least 100 meters before the turning into Gravel Pit Lane to avoid them turning into our driveway.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): B4632, Southam, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5342541&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drains blocked by mud, 20th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5342111</link>
<description>There are 3 drains in this location all of which are blocked due to unauthorised vehicles bringing thick mud in an access only lane. There are road closure bollards so this happens constantly and vehicles of all sizes use our drive entrance to turn. Our driveway has been ruined by this. My husband has persevered by doing his bit to help by unblocking the drains with a spade but itâ€™s now become too much. The lane is so bad now and we have witnessed many slips and falls. It is so bad and treacherous to walk when dark as no lighting. Action-Needs a good clean up and drains sorted. Need to stop unauthorised traffic. The location is from Watermead following the lane towards the road closure bollards.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Green Street, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5342111&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rocking man hole cover creating additional noise, 20th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5341276</link>
<description>Manhole cover outside 39 Lambert avenue, off centre in the carriage way. The carriageway around the cover is deteriorating allowing the cover to rock in it&amp;#39;s support as cars drive over it. This is creating a &amp;quot;double knock&amp;quot; type loud noise each time a car passes. And each movement degrades the support around the cover each time. Noise has started within this last 2 weeks and is getting incrementally worse. There are other potholes in this area of the street. Thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5341276.0.jpeg?95a84b30&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 39, Lambert Avenue, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5341276&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
