<title>Loose drain cover, 15th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4790438</link>
<description>This drain cover was loose when we moved into the flat opposite in Nov 22 and was kindly repaired a few months later due to it making 2 loud noises every time a car drove past. Sadly, it has started making the same loud noise so has presumably come loose again. It caused many sleepless night so will cause the same problem now the noise has returned. Please can you fix it asap? Me and my partner can’t go through months of sleepless nights like we experienced before. The drain cover is on the junction between Gauntlet Road and Typhoon way. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4790438.0.jpeg?427f5d34&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Typhoon Way, Upton St. Leonards, Stroud&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4790438&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement mostly mud and overgrown foliage, 14th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4787020</link>
<description>This stretch of pavement on the north side of East Approach Drive has for a long time consisted of only a narrow stretch of tarmac and a wide stretch of what was grass verge but is now predominantly mud, and puddles when there&amp;#39;s rain. The narrow stretch of tarmac is now also overgrown with foliage from the adjoining properties, making it even impossible for even one person to walk on the tarmac part at points, and if more than one, someone has to get their feet muddy. The problem has been been getting worse over the years, and it has been embarrassing recently taking a visiting guest here for the Music Festival along this stretch of pavement to a concert at the Pump Room. The muddy part is made even worse by parents of pupils at Pittville School mounting the &amp;#39;pavement&amp;#39; to sit and wait to pick up their children around 3pm despite the double yellow lines on the road beside. It would be best to have the whole section tarmacked (and possibly with bollards to stop the parking), and the neighbours asked to cut back their hedges/foliage.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4787020.0.jpeg?8a909832&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, East Approach Drive, Cleevemount, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4787020&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Hole in the pavement which had barriers around it for weeks but nothing was done, 13th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4783663</link>
<description>Hi guys, I reported a hole in a manhole/utility access civer in Regent St earlier this year and for a long time, there were barriers surrounding it. But these barriers were constantly collapsing and going walkabout and some were being used by local business owners/managers to reserve parking spaces. The original call was: &amp;quot;There has been a hole in the pavement in Pittville Street for many weeks and there was a barrier around it but Cheltenham BID Ambassadors are continually picking them up, putting them back whilst there is no sign of the problem being rectified. But it now appears that a local business has acquired one of the barriers to help them reserve a parking spot. Please help!&amp;quot; It now appears that the barriers have been removed but the very problem they were guarding is still as it was. On Fix My Street, I went to report it as Not Fixed but the link had expired&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4783663.0.jpeg?534b320d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 9, Winchcombe Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4783663&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Collapsing lane surface, 13th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4782177</link>
<description>The left side of Gravel Walk lane is collapsing and becoming a cause of concern for vehicles using it to access our homes. Over many years work on the substation has been carried out and recently a car damaged the area. Which was repaired. The whole area has become impacted with stones and rubble making the access even narrower and becoming difficult for our vehicles and visitors to use. This issue has been gradually getting worse over many years. .&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gravel Walk, Southam, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4782177&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
