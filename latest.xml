<title>Is this vehicle abandoned?, 22nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4813890</link>
<description>The vehicle has been here for a couple of weeks. It maybe untaxed and have no MOT but hasn’t been SORNed. There are a number of elderly people nearby that now have at least one less parking space for their convenience.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4813890.0.jpeg?6fa563f1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Fairhaven Avenue, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4813890&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>New road markings causing a safety hazard, 22nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4813793</link>
<description>New Road markings have been added to the road as part of the new parking scheme. This has resulted in creating a dangerous bottle neck, obscuring visibility on cars turning in / out of side roads. I witness a number of near misses yesterday. These changes are dangerous to road users and need to be reversed immediately.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4813793.0.jpeg?f333b01b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 141, Hewlett Road, Whaddon, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4813793&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Red button light on pelican crossing not working, 21st July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4811598</link>
<description>The light to indicate the pedestrian button has been pressed has not been working on the north west side for a year or so. I appreciate that this does not stop the lights from changing, however, since this is heavily used by local primary school, it would be helpful if this was working correctly to help teach the children road safety.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 94, Sheldons Court, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4811598&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Approaching these lights Eastbound on the A40 coming from Cheltenham they can’t be seen till too late due to overgrown foliage, particularly the set on the right. This presents a severe risk due to potential for late braking when lights can finally be seen.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A40, Shipton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4807279&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Significant drainage issue with gully over footway, 20th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4807205</link>
<description>Albert House on Charles Street is suffering from extreme foundational damp that&amp;#39;s causing long-term damage - it really needs a site visit and the pipes through the gully are getting blocked with water. There are two narrow drains that are missing metal covers and they&amp;#39;ve been tarmacked over. In the photo I&amp;#39;ve added the tarmac has collapsed and blocked the drain entirely so no water can escape out into the roadway to drain away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could you call Steve Ayres on 07917044454 to discuss the situation please? He&amp;#39;s a property manager and has been trying to resolve this for ages. Thanks so much, Tabi&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4807205.0.jpeg?aca89ed9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 13, Charles Street, St Paul’s, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4807205&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Travellers, 20th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4806414</link>
<description>Travellers have started turning up next to the kids play area. As scruffy as Cheltenham looks already this makes it look worse and we all know that they will make noise and leave a mess. Right on top of the school holidays. It means that many people will stop using the park and will stop walking their dogs in that area.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 8, Gristmill Close, Springbank, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4806414&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>A portion of the road surface in Apple Tree Close (by No 10) has been marked for repair, but if you look along this stretch of road there is more surface missing than there is present! It needs a complete resurface. The portion that has been marked isn’t even the worst bit. Might be worth reassessing before work commences.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Apple Tree Close, Woodmancote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4804904&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
