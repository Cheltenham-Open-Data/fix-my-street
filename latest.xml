<title>Whole-lane wide potholed area, 28th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7048955</link>
<description>There is an incredibly rough patch of potholes on Hatherley Lane, opposite the entrance to Wade Court, which is now so damaged it is very dangerous to cyclists. The section has obviously been patched up at some point, but it has been deteriorating and disintegrating rapidly the last few weeks. It is so wide that it takes up most of the width of the lane, and takes up the whole remaining width when there are cars parked. As a cyclist, I have to move onto that section to pass the parked cars. I can&amp;#39;t go all the way around the potholes because that would bring me into the opposite lane. Last week I hit the patch so hard, the contents of my basket bounced out and my front light flew off and got run over by the car behind. Today I was cut up by an impatient driver as I tried to slow down and avoid the patch. I&amp;#39;m afraid to signal right and go into the opposite lane (if empty), as cars behind will think I&amp;#39;m turning into Wade Court and undertake me. Honestly this section of road frightens me now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hatherley Lane, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7048955&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road signage, 28th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7048484</link>
<description>At the bottom of Birdlip Hill by the twelve bells pub there are signs saying road closed , however cars and other traffic are going up and down Birdlip Hill as normal also Lorrieâ€™s and large vans . I have spoken to Severn Trent they tell me that they have work being done on Green Lane which meets Birdlip Hill Severn Trent told me they have not closed Birdlip Hill .So can you please clarify is BIRDLIP HILL CLOSED OR NOT IF IT IS NOT CLOSED CAN YOU PLEASE ARRANGE ASAP for the signage to be removed .What this means to me and other parents is the stagecoach public service bus the 882 which takes our children to school in Cirencester it makes them late for school as the bus driver he turns around and goes up the 417 by the old air ballon pub which obviously takes him longer it is not the drivers fault he is just adhering tin the signs in front of him.
