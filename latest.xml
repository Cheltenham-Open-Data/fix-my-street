<title>Leaves and mud making pavement impassable, 21st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5611193</link>
<description>From a resident: &amp;quot;Four or five times a week I walk down Manor Road to go to Sainsbury&amp;#39;s/Tewkesbury Road and in the last couple of months the footpath has been in a terrible condition with both compacted fallen leaves and mud. I&amp;#39;m aware that we&amp;#39;ve had non-stop road works down there for the last couple of months and more recently the deliveries of manure to the field down the road but in over forty years in the village I can&amp;#39;t ever remember the footpath being in such a dreadful condition. Baring in mind that children going to the school use this path I would hate for someone to slip on this often treacherous surface and fall into the road. Is there any chance that the footpath can be cleaned up?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Manor Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5611193&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Significant potholes, 21st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5610258</link>
<description>A series of potholes on road while heading East. These are inline with where a car&amp;#39;s tires would be so are causing damage. Due to narrowness and bendiness of road it is impossible to avoid these. This has been present for years. Why was this not resolved when the road was closed off for resurfacing in January? Some of these potholes are only a few metres away from where the road was resurfaced.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Gloucester Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5610258&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>email rcvd 09.02.24 - Lansdown Parade, Cheltenham, GL50 2LH. We constantly have a blocked drain right at the front if our house.

You do have people sweeping leaves now and then, but the never pick them up, they just leave piles which blow around and re distribute!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What can you do to help us please?&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5609657&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
