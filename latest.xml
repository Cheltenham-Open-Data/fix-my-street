<title>Systemic blocked drain issue, 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7055541</link>
<description>I&amp;#39;ve reported this particular drain before and work was carried out, however, it has made no difference at all. Straight after the work was completed the drain still looked sunken into the kerb and flooding was not sorted. I&amp;#39;ve walked from the top of Prestbury High St. to part way down Prestbury Rd. and many of the drains are partially or fully blocked. This is a long-term issue (years) where the whole drainage system in this area needs looking at. Even if one is unblocked, the next one down the road might still stop the flow of water.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7055541.0.jpeg?5ad6634b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Prescott Walk, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7055541&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>I would like to bring to your attention a safety concern related to the Southam Lane bus stop, which is frequently used by GE Aerospace employees. I inadvertently reported this issue under the incorrect section labeled &quot;Traffic Lights,&quot; and I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. As a regular user of bus D from the Southam Lane stop, I have observed that crossing the road at this point poses significant risks. There is currently no pedestrian traffic light at this intersection, requiring pedestrians to watch for vehicles coming from three different directions. Furthermore, there are two traffic lights for cars in opposing lanes, which adds to the confusion from a pedestrian standpoint. I have witnessed instances where vehicles have disregarded the red light, creating a hazardous situation for those crossing the road. The potential for a serious accident is a genuine concern, especially since this crossing is heavily utilized by fellow employees. I strongly recommend the installation of a dedicated pedestrian traffic light and overall improvements to the crossing to enhance pedestrian safety. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Elif, 29th January</title>

<title>Drop kerb to small for entry to address, 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7054660</link>
<description>Hello there is already a job in progress. TMC - Defects - Other problem Reported in the TMC - Defects - Other category by Gloucestershire County Council at 14:32 29/01/25 Reference: JOB_42567231 This is a recurring problem caused by the drop kerb being too small for the drive entry. Any filling and reseeding of verge will just be eroded by vehicles entering the drive. A hole develops which causes damage to tyres and underside of vehicles. If the drop kerb is widened then no future issues will be caused. This saves money to the council in the long run. Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7054660.0.jpeg?9ff6165f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 60, Beeches Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7054660&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
