<title>3 Sharp edged Potholes along Cleeve Common Road, 29th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2409755</link>
<description>The marker is set to the last pothole of the 3, on the Cleeve Common Road going to the common. There are 2 more of concern on the way to this last one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All three are almost unavoidable as the road is single track and either near side or offside tyres will tend to hit them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While these are the main 3, there are several developing at the edge of this road where vehicles have had to go over the sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can they be fixed as soon as possible.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Cleeve Common, Whittington&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2409755&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Numerous potholes along the length of Hoo Lane again., 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2409531</link>

<title>Lack of road signs, 24th November</title>

<description>When the A417 Crickley Hill was blocked due to an accident last week an arcticulated lorry trying to find a way around the blockage drove up Dog Lane and became stuck at three places and needed to be towed by tractor at two locations and at 9:30pm by a recovery vehicle. As a very narrow and winding lane with steep sections Dog Lane would benefit from unsuitable for HGV and unsuitable for long vehicle signs at either end.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Smiths Barn Bentham Lane, Bentham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2403246&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree overgrown and will soon bring down phone wires, 23rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2402250</link>
<description>Tree on the corner outside no 7 New Barn Close has been neglected for years and has grown so big it is now tangled in the overhead phone wires. If these wires come down the residents will be without a phone (for how long no-one knows) and some do not have mobiles. BT refuse to do anything and say it is the Council’s responsibility (which it quite rightly is) since the Council own the tree and the land it grows on. The Council did send a work party out recently but all they did was prune a few lower branches.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 7 New Barn Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2402250&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
