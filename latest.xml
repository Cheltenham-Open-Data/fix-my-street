<title>Traffic Light Sequencing Issues, 4th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5667183</link>
<description>Since the resurfacing works have been undertaken there are issues with: Lights in Carisbrook Rd not letting cars go, missing a sequence on 1-2 light change cycles, leading to cars backing up on Carisbrooke Rd and into Billbrook Rd. Lights on Hucclecote Rd and junction with Churchdown Lane/Carslisbrooke Rd, travelling towards Delta Way from Barnwood, only letting 3-4 cars pass but traffic light on other direction towards Barnwood is on green for a lot longer. Took me 15 minutes to travel from Wagon &amp;amp; Horses to Green Lane today.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Carisbrooke Road, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5667183&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 4th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5666660</link>
<description>20/02/24 email rcvd, passed from Cheltenham BC - Hi&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many years ago a tree was removed from the footpath edge outside 19 Copt Elm Road. Over the years I be seen Tree staff visit, including last year when a planting team arrived, but could not do anything as the stump remains in the ground. I wonder when we will get a new tree, just as has been planted outside 15 Copt Elm Road. Have you an update please?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5666660&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Daft Road Signage, 4th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5666153</link>
<description>Traffic on the A40 or A436 heading towards Oxford meet a road sign diverting them on to the closed (fro maintenance) section of the A40. As a consequence 50% ignore the road closure, and the other 50% come into the little village of Shipton Oliffe (with its small roads, pothole problems, tiny bridges and fords). When I tried to explian the problem to a Highways man in a truck, he swore at me.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5666153.0.jpeg?149818ac&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A436, Shipton, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5666153&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
