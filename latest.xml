<title>Tree has consumed all light from lamp post due to encroachment, 25th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6512611</link>
<description>Property owner of Tree is Browbridge situated on Pirton Lane by the railway bridge. Light is there to help light the narrow pathway and road for both pedestrians and motorists. Due to encroachment it has little effect for either user, making the area poorly lit and dangerous. With the winter nights coming this must be sorted.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pirton Lane, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6512611&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree debris on cycle path, 24th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6512230</link>
<description>There is substantial tree debris (conkers, conker shells, fir cones, leaves) along the cycle path from Elmbridge Court to the hare and hounds in Churchdown which presents a significant risk of an accident for the many children using the cycle path every day. It could do with being swept on a weekly basis during the autumn.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6512230&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>I have been contacted by local residents over a long time about this issue. An example is pasted here., 24th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6511934</link>
<description>Top of Post Office Lane.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;“Area of concern where over nearly the last two years the performance of Glos Highways has been poor: The Cleeve Hill community centred on Post Office lane and the B4632 from Stockwell lane down to &amp;quot; the View&amp;quot;. Issues:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A. Because of blocked gullies and blocked/ damaged drains large volumes of water accumulate on the B4632 during storms and then cascade down Post Office lane because kerbs/stone sets need resetting at the top of Post Office Lane. B. The kerbs /stone sets down the left of Post Office Lane do not keep the water on the carriageway.Instead they turn left at the Coach House drive a then through the fence to the Manse causing the damage reported by Paul Dawson. C. Water flowing down Post Office lane should be taken by a gully on the carriageway by the outside of The Western Power enclosure..The gully is blocked and the pipe into the combined drain in the middle of the road is collapsed and marked for repair .The stone sets in this area allow water to bypass the gully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of the above has been reported many times to Glos Highways on the phone and using fix my street.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lack of coordinated action in the area by Glos Highways caused all the problems that Mr Dawson had over the weekend.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These will reoccur during the winter and IN ADDITION if we have a cold winter the area on the B4632 will either turn to ice, if very cold, or as happened two winters ago the spray from the water will freeze into slush/snow.”&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): B4632, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6511934&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Verge not cut this year, 24th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6511621</link>
<description>This is the pavement from Greenacre Way to the D bus stop opposite Valentine Road in Bishop&amp;#39;s Cleeve. It has not been strimmed etc this year since January 2024. We were told that all verges were to be cut twice a year minimum. Running behind it is a culvert from the balancing pond at the other side of the Greenacre Way junction. Completely overgrown with weeds and rubbish. The pavement needs spraying as the weeds have broken the tarmac. The pavement is now so narrow that two people cannot pass and further down towards the entrance to the old orchard, it is impossible to walk on the pavement. Please sort ASAP. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6511621.0.jpeg?65d05b27&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Evesham Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6511621&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Customer reported blocked drains. Need clearing out but cars park over them so it requires some enforcement to have the cars park elsewhere while the drains are cleared. Last time we set out cones and motorists simply moved them. Desperately needs doing however, as caused flooding. &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6510592&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
