<title>Cycle path deteriorating on A40 from Triumph Cheltenham to the Lansdown Pub, 6th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5678597</link>
<description>The cycle on the A40 (opposite Dean Close Prep School) from Triumph Cheltenham to the Lansdown Pub is very poor. Significant damage could be caused to bike due to the condition of the tarmac which has potholes and roots growing out of it. It&amp;#39;s flatter and safer to cycle on the road. The new green cycle path further on past TGI Fridays is lovely!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 60, Lansdown Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5678597&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Enquiry Number: 22042747, 6th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5677629</link>
<description>Web Reference: 5661967 Enquiry Number: 22042747 Issue: Pothole on the Pavement Location: On the right hand side of pavement of Christchurch road when facing Christ Churchbetween Well Place and Malvern Road. This is a very busy pavement and is extremely dangerous as can be seen via the photos. Site: CHRISTCHURCH ROAD&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The repair has now been completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who-ever has reported back to you that this work has been completed is lying. I have just completed my walk past this area and there is no evidence of any work having taken place what so ever. The pavement is exactly as per the photos I filed with yourselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please ensure that the work order is reinstate and hopefully it shall be done this time – properly! This is a pavement that school children use every day to walk from their boarding houses to the main school and should not be left in such a poor condition.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Christchurch Road, Lansdown, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5677629&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>High kerb, 6th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5677001</link>
<description>At the end of the slip road, as you are about to join the roundabout below the A40 there is a raised kerb. I reported this to Gloucestershire CC a few years ago, who told me this would be passed to Highways England. My daughter clipped this kerb on a dark evening when she was returning home with her 2 young children. She was slowing down at the foot of the slip road when she was momentarily blinded by a car joining the slip road from the A 40. By the time she realised she had damaged her tyre she was on the slip road joining the North bound M5. She phoned me and I rushed to change her tyre. There was some major work being done on this roundabout recently and a couple of weeks ago I noticed traffic had been been going over this raised kerb. Whilst drivers should stick to the carriageway, this kerb is only inches away and the reality is drivers do drive over it. Is there something that needs to be done here&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Golden Valley Junction, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5677001&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fence being put up on grass verge, 6th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5676988</link>
<description>Lower Farm Upper Coberley, GL53 9RD The owner of Lower Farm is putting up a fence along the grass verge to the road - as far as I am aware this is not her land, the boundary is her wall and grass is council owned land - please advise? The fence will stop cars from avoiding any oncoming traffic, dogs and dog walkers, horses and children as the owner of Lower Farm has already created a blind spot on a dangerous bend by growing foliage out into the road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5676988.0.jpeg?7700cb82&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5676988&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
