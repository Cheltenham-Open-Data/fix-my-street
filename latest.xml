<title>A pothole in road problem, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5538007</link>
<description>On Monday 22nd January I was driving along Imperial Square GL50 1QG. It was dark, raining and there was surface water. Suddenly there was a violent impact to my N/S front wheel, I was unaware of any damage at the time. However on returning to my vehicle one hour  later, now parked in Bath Road, I found the N/S front tyre to be flat and my car was undrivable and I had to get home by other means.&amp;#10;The following day I had to return with an electronic inflator which gave sufficient pressure to get me to National Tyres on Royal Well at approximately 3pm. Their conclusion was that the tyre had been irreparably damaged by the impact, and required replacement. A subsequent visit to the street reveals the nature of the problem, a deep pothole for which I include photographic evidence.&amp;#10;I am therefore claiming the cost of said tyre, only replaced new in early December 2023, from yourselves as a result of your failure to maintain the street in question to a safe and legal manner. To date the pothole remains a hazard, and no attempt has been made by any agency to identify or repair it.&amp;#10;I await your reimbursement by return.&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5538007&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The entire length of Caernarvon Road!!!, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5536066</link>
<description>The entire length of this road is shocking to say the least. Multiple potholes, multiple patchwork repairs failing, Speed humps are like driving over kerbs. How many more times does this need reporting before proper action takes place?!! Maybe when you&amp;#39;re done resurfacing the more affluent areas you&amp;#39;ll give this road the attention it so desperately needs......I won&amp;#39;t hold my breath though as this saga has been ongoing for years!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 129, Caernarvon Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5536066&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Vehicle blocking public access - not the first time, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5535984</link>
<description>Vehicles regularly blocking the shared path on the Honeybourne line. Workers responsible were discovered near waitrose bridge, so no excuse for blocking access where they were. This happens also with the sub station parking on the path too. It&amp;#39;s frustrating negotiating bad and inconsiderate parking in Cheltenham.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5535984.0.jpeg?8a78c4a7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Honeybourne, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5535984&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
