<title>26&quot; x 13&quot; x 4&quot; deep, 31st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5159236</link>
<description>1 Brunswick Buildings Bethesda St Cheltenham GL50 2AZ You will know that I live on a very busy commuter street in Cheltenham, used by heavy goods vehicles and general traffic alike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will also know from your records that I brought to your attention a pothole directly outside my property which was patch filled within the past 18 months or so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I attach photos of the pothole now. It&amp;#39;s overall length is 26&amp;quot;, 13&amp;quot; wide, 4&amp;quot;. This pothole is as close to the front of my property as it could be. My front door and back gate both open directly onto the pavement which is permanently splattered in loose pieces of tarmac and road material which is then tracked into my house.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No vehicles travelling this road can avoid the pothole since there is parking on the other side of the road leaving only one vehicle&amp;#39;s width.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I had my house painted in August 2021 and am dismayed to see the level of damage incurred to its&amp;#39; walls at low level, newly fitted window, new back gate and front door as a direct result of this pothole.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In fact, for some time I have become hesitant and nervous when opening either door or gate to exit that I will be sprayed and harmed by flying pieces of sharp road material. This is true of course for all pedestrians.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please give this matter the urgency and attention it requires.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yours sincerely&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rachel Tucker&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5159236.0.jpeg?7e002711&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Bethesda Street, Montpellier, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5159236&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Uneven surface and overgrown vegetation, 31st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5158945</link>
<description>Today a group of volunteers among with myself (Councillor Sarah Hands, Tewkesbury Borough Council) spent two hours clearing as much vegetation from this alley as possible as it had become impassible. I would like to see the county council finish the job. The path is extremely uneven with a lot of it taken over by soil and broken away.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5158945.0.jpeg?050cf68a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Innsworth Lane, Innsworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5158945&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Loose/rattling cover/ironwork problem, 31st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5158822</link>
<description>email rec 31/10/2023 Dear Sir or Madam&amp;#10;My wife and I are in the process of refurbishing the above property, which we bought last autumn. We have discovered serious levels of moisture penetrating the north wall, being that facing the highway (Old Gloucester Road). The level of the carriageway and public footpath is significantly higher than that of the internal ground-floor. There is no land between the curtilage of the property and the highway, such that the tarmac footpath directly abuts the north wall.&amp;#10;I am concerned that the surface water drainage or other pipework might have failed, leading to the subsoil beneath the highway and footpath becoming saturated. &amp;#10;Whatever the underlying cause of the dampness, it will need to be remedied in order to prevent mould and other risks injurious to health.&amp;#10;I look forward to hearing from you.&amp;#10;Yours faithfully&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5158822&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
