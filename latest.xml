<description>email rcvd 07.11.23 - Hello,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I&amp;#39;m mailing as we have a rather lovely tree outside our house at 18 Glencairn Park Rd, Cheltenham GL50 2ND but some of the branches have grown a lot this year and are now resting on electricity/telephone wires. With high winds forecast I&amp;#39;m concerned they may cause a problem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I&amp;#39;ve attached some images for you. Could you come and take a look/prune the tree back a bit? Thank you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Very best,&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5193854&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drain outside 104 Fairview Rd, 9th November</title>

<description>This drain has been blocked for a long time. It has been reported previously but no action taken. It often emits a very unpleasant odour as well as the blockage, which results in flooding further down the street.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5193681.0.jpeg?7a9ae312&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 106, Fairview Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5193681&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Floodlights shining through bedroom window, 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5193312</link>
<description>The floodlights are on the new housing development that is being built opposite. However due to some recent thefts they have put up some floodlights. These lights shine through my daughter’s bedroom window and are keeping her awake at night. If they were turned slightly it wouldn’t be so bad but they are directly shining through the window.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hayden Road, Springbank, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5193312&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5193369</link>
<description>email rcvd 07.11.23 - Hello,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I wish to report that there are a row of conifers from the front garden of a property which are encroaching onto the footway alongside the brook on Wymans Brook  (they take up over half of the footpath). This necessitates an uncomfortable walk along this bit as your feet are on an angle and you will need to go single file (not ideal if you are pushing a pram and holding another child’s hand).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Would it be possible for the owner of the property to trim them back ?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I think they are outside number 28 Yew Tree Close (the row that fronts onto the brook itself).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many thanks for your help&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5193369&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Parking now worse due to road markings, 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5192579</link>
<description>Fairview street recently had the new Z permit parking installed, with the idea being that this would make parking on the road easier for residents. However due to the apalling use of road markings and increased double yellow lines it is now harder to park. The dedicated spaces marked on the road are big not big enough for the amount of cars on the road, so I often find I am parking elsewhee on roads that I dont pay to park on. It is obviously the council trying to make money off residents by buying permits, which everyone knows, but the lack of benefit from this is appalling. Please reconsider the parking lines and remove the unecessary extended double yellows on the road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 64, Fairview Street, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5192579&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Red light not working., 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5192486</link>
<description>The red light on the traffic light at the exit of North Upton Lane into Barnwood Road/Hucclecote Road has not been working for several weeks now. I&amp;#39;m surprised that there is no option to select for that problem as surely a non-operational red light is far more dangerous than a non-operational amber or green. For that reason I had to select &amp;#39;vandalised&amp;#39; in order to report it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): North Upton Lane, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5192486&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
