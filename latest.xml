<title>5 Potholes, 4th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4399201</link>
<description>Come on……. There is a stretch along this road which is TERRIBLE and DANGEROUS. It’s next to a school and also close to a bus stop. Today your lot have been out and filled a few of the potholes but left many there. I suggest you try driving down that stretch of road and see how appalling it is. It makes little difference that you’ve filled a few of the potholes. You need to resurface a complete section of that road. These photos were taken at 5.30pm tonight just about 15 metres from where you’ve filled a few holes today. What a total waste of time and money to only do half a job. This stretch needs totally resurfacing. It’s dangerous. The potholes in photos are over 75mm deep. The ones you’ve not filled at the bus stop also need relooking at as it’s like a farm track (actually it’s worse than a farm track). What hope do elderly etc have of crossing the road safely once they’ve got off the bus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Come on Gloucestershire Highways, sort it out. It’s a disgrace.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4399201.0.jpeg?2d21044a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 1 Peel Close, East End&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4399201&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Parking, 4th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4398808</link>
<description>Hello&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the last few years we have had a major issue with our neighbours who run a child minders from their home. They insist on allowing their customers to persistently block our drive and garage access. They have gone so far as to tell their customers that they own our driveway and to ignore our complaints. This is a business operating out of a residential home causing years worth of issues for all of their neighbours. Is there nothing that you can do? I have dozens of photographs as evidence if needed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4398808.0.jpeg?f1aa6933&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 35 Medoc Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4398808&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The footpaths running from Coombe Hill to The Leigh on the A38 are almost unusable. I struggled with the pushchair. They&amp;#39;re very uneven, have large potholes, are covered in mud and grass and have brambles protruding out from the hedges. The verges have almost taken over the path in some places.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4396574.0.jpeg?07b8b872&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Hillview Cottage A38, Coombe Hill&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4396574&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
