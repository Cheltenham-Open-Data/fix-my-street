<title>Collapsed system beyond drain. This blocked drain has been reported many times., 21st March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5750551</link>
<description>Outside 89 and 91 Hucclecote road. This drain was cleared last year and the hose to flush out the blockage into main pipe sysyem got caught and had to be cut off. The hose remains in the drain leading through into the main rain water sewer system under the road. I was told last year that the sewer pipe had collapsed beyond the drain and had to be fixed. Tonight workers came to clean out the drain to remove any debris from the road works when laying new tarmac. I explaind to them that the cleaning hose was still in the drain leading through to the main sewer system. It got struck in the collapsed debris beyound the surface drain. When they pumped water through it last year, it could be seen coming out of the pavement on the opposite side of the road. When is the damaged pipe going to get fixed as it will just block up the drain again causing water to pool in this area. It&amp;#39;s a shame this could not have been done before the new road surface was laid. I was told last year that it would be reported as a collapsed drain system.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Road, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5750551&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic lights changing too quickly creating congestion, 21st March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5749515</link>
<description>The traffic lights at this location on the Hucclecote Road near the Hucclecote Methodist Church are changing too quickly. This is creating significant congestion on the Hucclecote Road, of 20 plus cars. The sequencing of the lights needs to be changed back to what it was before the road works so more cars can flow. I now have cars, double decker buses etc stationary outside my house regularly during the day, which hasn&amp;#39;t happened before. This has created access issues to the house, noise, reduced privacy and additional pollution.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Road, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5749515&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Lack of concrete curb stones on Battledown Approach between Battledown Drive and Haywards Lane, 21st March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5748930</link>
<description>There is a lack of concrete curb stones on Battledown Approach between Battledown Drive and Haywards Lane. There is a school on Battledown Approach which means that twice a day parents are parking vehicles on what were once grass verges but now are muddy swamps (see attached photo of just one of several affected sections). This mud mixes with the leaves and twigs from the trees and is washed into the drains, causing blockages and covering the gulleys. There is a risk that it will block the combined sewer which would result in residents experiencing raw sewerage in their homes. In addition the edge of the road is being gradually broken up due to the lack of curbing. There is also an impact on the pavement which is becoming increasingly difficult for people with mobility issues to navigate.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5748930.0.jpeg?b2979cae&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Battledown Approach, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5748930&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
