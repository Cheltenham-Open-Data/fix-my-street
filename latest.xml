<title>Road cracking due to subsidence, 1st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5273376</link>
<description>The tree is oversized and apparently was planted without a root barrier (which other tree have in the road - this was a replacement tree for one which died shortly after planting). There has also been a bund dug in the open space to avoid flooding and these two issues would appear to have caused the ground under the road to move and create the crack. The Parish council are removing the tree but asked me to report this to you as the road cracking is considered to be subsidence as there are several other examples around the estate. Bloor Homes have confirmed that under the S38 agreement, all the estate roads are now the responsibility of Gloucestershire County Council.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5273376.0.jpeg?7c0cec8c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hurricane Drive, Stoke Orchard, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5273376&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
