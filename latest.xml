<title>Large branch fell and just missed passers by on the pavement, 14th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5440044</link>
<description>Outside property large tree on highway needs pollarding All of the trees do after Church road end upto Old Bath Road. The large birds jump around the trees and the branches fall as well as high winds causing this large branch to fall. This has been an ongoing issue for years. The trees will be a lot healthier if they were cut back. The street lights can’t light the pavements up in parts because the trees are so large.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5440044.0.jpeg?2fa32df8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 216a, Leckhampton Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5440044&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Holes in road from removal of studs/markings, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5436438</link>
<description>On the B4063 between the fire station and entrance to Pirton Fields there are holes in the road from the removal of studs/road markings prior to the cycle lane being installed. These are noticeable holes that ideally require filling at least temporarily. It could be argued that the road needs attention since the works to install the cycle lane has caused a patchwork surface.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5436438&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
