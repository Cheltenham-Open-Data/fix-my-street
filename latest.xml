<title>Gate chained and locked to exit field on public right of way, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6414647</link>
<description>If travelling by road, take the turning towards Tredington from the Odessa pub on the A38. Go past Southend farm to your left. The gate to the next field on the left is chained and locked, preventing ease of access to the public right of way. The issue has been present for at least a few months.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6414647.0.jpeg?8991fcc8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stoke Road, Stoke Orchard, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6414647&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street Lighting inop all along Kingsmead Road, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6414395</link>
<description>All along Kingsmead Road from the junction of Princess Elizabeth Way, through to the junction of Village Road, there is zero operable street lights!! They seem to have been working on and off since CityFibre had dug up the road for the first time a little while back, but have now been off for a few weeks. People having to use flash lights to walk down the road as it’s so dark. It seems to have been reported but not acted upon and it seems that Kingsmead close and Kingsmead Avenue are also suffering what has to be a linked fault. Can we get this fixed ASAP please?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6414395.0.jpeg?ba5f95d7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 23, Kingsmead Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6414395&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Broken bridge slats, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412690</link>
<description>These have been reported in a number of occasions before and the matter has not been resolved and is becoming quite dangerous. 3-4 slats are completely missing and are a serious risk if I just. This needs URGENT attention as it is a vital thoroughfare. Please make an effort to resolve this before it becomes an emergency. Suggest you check ALL slats rather than just bridge the existing problem.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gevum Way, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412690&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Grass verge needs cutting so that I can cut my hedge, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412181</link>
<description>The verge on the Shurdington Road between Silverthorne Close and Kenelm Gardens needs cutting urgently. Our house at 67 Merestones Drive has gated access and we are trying to sell our house. I cannot cut my hedge on the road side due to this and it is full of litter and a major eyesore which is not helping our house sale. This used to be lawn which I looked after until the pavement was made wider and nobody appears to be looking after it now. Please can you cut all the weeds down as soon as possible.
