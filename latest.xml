<title>Light Sequence is not right, 8th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189856</link>
<description>Everyday between approx 1600 and 1730 there are large queues of traffic leaving the industrial estate and airport (i.e 100metres or more of queing) as the lights are at red far longer than they appear to be for traffic at the other directions where no traffic is going past the lights in the other directions, when the lights do change there maybe 6 or 8 cars get past before the lights go to red again, when the other roads still have little or no traffic waiting - the light sequence needs to be sorted !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bamfurlong Lane, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189856&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Lights not letting traffic to main road, 8th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189677</link>
<description>Traffic is building up hugely right back to the airport thanks to the poorly programmed lights releasing traffic at this junction. I was stuck for 15 minutes trying to leave the airport today in backed up traffic. All other feed roads to this junction are clear. This needs to be fixed asap and is extremely frustrating. Will be putting on twitter if not solved immediately.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bamfurlong Lane, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189677&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A big pothole not marked, 8th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189202</link>
<description>’m glad that you fixed the pothole but who is going to fix my daughters legs ? Her knees are so sore and she is having trouble trying to get around,, She has 7 children and this walking was the only thing that was helping her mental and physical health? I can’t believe that this is the solution that you have come up with? My daughter is having trouble walking now ,, Please don’t fob me off with the ‘pothole has now been fixed’ this is not acceptable,, Evelyn Blake 11441767&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5189202.0.jpeg?5795cd10&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2;4;6;8;10;12, Winterbotham Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189202&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Section of poorly maintained cycleway adjacent to 208 Hucclecote road, 8th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189097</link>
<description>This area suffers from multiple problems, including overgrown vegetation on either side of the cycle way, as well as an area of poor drainage, which is also than London, too, is an accumulation of detritus along the edge of the transfer between the roadway and the cycle way. There is overgrown vegetation. Also on the foot away alongside the roadway. I am in the right-hand side of the supplied photograph. And&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An additional problem in this area is that the cycle wife comes to immediate halt, rather than carrying along the side of the road and long-term there needs to be a cycle improvement scheme along Hucclecote Road/Ermin Street to provide better sustainable transport links. Additionally, given the cyclists need to now cross the road to rejoin the traffic. The design of the junction onto the realigned Hucclecote Road is very poorly designed and consideration of some temporary re-signing and lining should be considered to make it safer for cyclists.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5189097.0.jpeg?fe015e4b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Valiant Way, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5189097&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>There is a section of a poorly maintained, pass the signpost at the end says it is called the brambles. Problems in this location are multiple and include the uneven footways surface as a result of tree growth underneath the foot way, as well as in maintain vegetation on either side of the path. This also continues round the corner behind the houses., 8th November</title>

<title>Very Long Deep Narrow Groove - Danger to Cyclists, 8th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5188914</link>
<description>London Road, Cheltenham as from shops (out of Cheltenham end) in the direction of the High Street. When cycling out of Keynsham Street (GL52 6) and turning right into London Road - several months ago (I kept meaning to report this - I don&amp;#39;t normally cycle here), the wheel of my bike became momentarily caught in what turned out to be a very lengthy deep groove in the centre of the left side of the road running a long way towards the High Street. While I managed to slow down and place my foot on the ground and get my wheel free, I am seriously concerned for the safety of other unsuspecting cyclists. Now nearly 70, I consider myself fortunate to have (narrowly) avoided falling off and sustaining an injury - possibly even falling into passing traffic. Only cyclists would be aware of this danger in this section of London Road. Please prioritise filling in this dangerous groove.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 107, London Road, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5188914&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Sustained damage problem, 8th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5188506</link>
<description>Bollards that appear to have been installed to prevent pavement parking/driving for motor vehicles near the flats have made the cycle path more dangerous and almost unusable. The pathway is already very narrow and putting bollards either side is an accident waiting to happen. Its too narrow for cyclists to pass each other when going in opposite directions!
