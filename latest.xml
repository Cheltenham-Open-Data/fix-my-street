<title>All pavement slabs around whaddon, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5573355</link>
<description>Please can you fix the pavements in Whaddon. My boy tripped over an uneven slab in Tamar road and smashed his face on the floor. The photo is after I cleaned him up! All the pavements around this area (severn road, wymans road, thames road, whaddon avenue, mersey road, clyde crescent, cleeve view, hewlett road etc) are all the same! Some are wobbly, most are cracked, bits sticking up etc. Even i’ve tripped a few times on them. They’ve been like this since I’ve lived here and they really need doing up. Even when posting about my boy tripping, on social media with no mention of area, a friend immediately said how bad the pavements are around here as knew it would have been near our homes (she’s Clyde crescent, close to where he tripped). Please can we make the area safer for ours kids. My boy is only 4!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5573355.0.jpeg?4b563f81&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 4, Tamar Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5573355&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Timing of lights need fixing, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5573140</link>
<description>Since the road was resurfaced the lights at kingsditch roundabout only lets 4, at best 5, cars through heading north at a time. It’s causing absolute chaos and miles of tailbacks. Also causing traffic to reroute through residential back streets to avoid the unnecessary build up of traffic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Princess Elizabeth Way, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5573140&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water bubbling up continuously from side of manhole cover outside Woolstone church, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5572887</link>
<description>This has been reported previously and apparently attended to with no effect. It requires the drain to be thoroughly assessed using endoscopy to visualise blockage/collapse of drain. The overflow results in a torrent of water running down the road crossing to the S side and entering a drain outside to Homer cottages. The stream brings down a load of mud from the increasingly damaged verges leaving an area of mud at the drive access to the garages which gets carried into the properties. Please address this, I and neighbours are very fed up over the lack of any effective action by Highways despite multiple representations. You have a public duty to sort this. Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5572887.0.jpeg?dd08251e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Oxenton, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5572887&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
