<title>Multpilemtree roots breaking though tarmac, 23rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5481791</link>
<description>Multiple tree roots breaking through the tarmac all the way along the cycle path. One near the pin dropped is particularly bad. Cyclists are either bouncing off the mound towards pedestrians or swerving onto the footpath to avoid it. I have broken a spine and nearly crashed into a pedestrian due to the dangerous condition of the cycleway. I suggest you have someone actually try and ride a bike on it to see.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lansdown Road, Montpellier, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5481791&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Hello,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our road was resurfaced last year, thank you very much. As a result the white lines outside our property, which we paid for,  were painted over.
