<title>Road surface subsiding, making it hard to get on drive, 4th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5281519</link>
<description>The problem is outside Broadclyst. I reported the problem in 2021 and was told it didn&amp;#39;t meet the criteria for fixing. The tarmac that provides a gentle slope between the road and our drive has gradually been washed away, leaving the effect of a step between the road and our drive. For the last 2 years we have struggled to get on and off the drive and have needed new suspension in one of our cars. Yesterday a delivery lorry was reversing onto the drive and caught its rear step on the drive because of the difference in height between the road and our drive. I&amp;#39;m worried that we will get sued or companies will refuse to deliver us if this is not fixed soon. I&amp;#39;m also worried that the whole thing may collapse.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5281519.0.jpeg?c09939f4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Church Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5281519&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The sign is illegible problem, 4th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5281486</link>
<description>I spoke to mum on Tuesday and she was very upset and agitated. Apparently, workmen started erecting a parking pole directly in front of her house, this will mean that cars will be able to park in that space adding to an already congested area&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5281486&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocking visibility on road/junction (Grass/verge) problem, 4th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5280955</link>
<description>Customer states she has walked on a bit of grass this afternoon, residents have come out of the property and shouted at her, they siad they have adopted the grass verge and not to walk on it. A male has threatened the customer and would follow them home and put dog faeces in their letter box. This sounds unlikely that an AHR would allow adoption of this grass area but they said they have paperwork. Sending for AHR to maybe inspect the location and see if any adjustments have been made to the area that may need rectifying by whoever has caused this. Customer was very upset by this and have advised they speak to the police in relation to the threats made towards them.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5280955&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 4th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5279772</link>
<description>email rcvd 02.12.23 - Hello Highways Department.    I live at:&amp;#10;WESTAL HOUSE.  4 ANDOVER WALK.  GL50. 2QY I notice that this week several potholes in our street have been marked with white stain which I presume means they are to be repaired.&amp;#10;Directly outside our house, in the kerb, there is a large pothole/ channel which has not been marked.&amp;#10;Please could this be included in the repair regime as it is deep and fills with water every time it rains.&amp;#10;Kind regards&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5279772&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Missing Bollards Gloucester Street, Winchcombe, 4th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5279394</link>
<description>The Council told me more than a year ago that the bollard outside 30/32 would be replaced in the next financial year. This morning at 9.50am a huge Portuguese artic lorry, on the way to Postlip Mill, mounted the pavement missing the porch over our front door by just 3 inches and going over all the relevant drain covers in the pavement. There are at least 4 bollards missing in Gloucester Street that have not been replaced. Why? Is it the councils policy now to endanger life and property?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 23, Gloucester Street, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5279394&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Several pot holes and length of roadway need repair, 4th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5279025</link>
<description>In the past couple of weeks 7 or 8 areas have been marked up for repair. However, the majority of the white paint has disappeared, worn off or been washed away. Certainly 2 of these areas had been previously marked over a year ago and then when the maintenance team arrived the markings had been washed away. No repair happened as they said if it’s not marked it can’t be repaired. Please ensure this doesn’t happen this time as some of these pot holes are dangerous.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Brockhampton Road, Sudeley, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5279025&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
