<title>Faulty Traffic Lights, 12th May</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5963934</link>
<description>Traffic lights outside Blossom Lodge Nursery on Hales Road are faulty. They are continually being triggered from green-to-red, without pedestrians pressing the button to cross. The lights are green for approximately 10 seconds only and then return to red, alongside which, the pedestrian &amp;#39;beeping&amp;#39; is also being triggered and is therefore playing at regular intervals. This short green-to-red cycle has been continual throughout this evening.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 77, Hales Road, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5963934&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
