<title>Appalling, unacceptable, and damaged road surface., 6th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6321062</link>
<description>Appalling, unacceptable, and damaged road surface. It affects both sides of the busy high street causing traffic to swerve dangerously. It&amp;#39;s been there for ages, and I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s been reported before. How much longer before the council deal with it? Unacceptable time to fix.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 58, High Street, Noverton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6321062&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Term time parking issues, 5th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6319177</link>
<description>During school months, this junction is an absolute mess every morning. Cars consistently park along this stretch of Collyberry Road, meaning that cars leaving the estate are either forced onto pavements when cars approach from Station Road, or they are forced to reverse back along Collberry Road. This is incredibly dangerous when there are children going to school. Further to this, issues can arise for cars trying to come into Collyberry Road, meeting cars coming out of the estate. Again, due to the selfishness of these lazy parkers, they are forced to use a single lane into Collyberry Road. Something needs to be done about this junction, preferably using double yellow lines for the full extent of the dashed line section. Cars often park only metres from the junction onto Station Road, which is utterly foolish and forces cars directly into the path of those coming into Collyberry Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6319177.0.jpeg?e03d1699&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Collyberry Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6319177&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overhanging trees causing danger to pedestrians, 5th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6318707</link>
<description>Hi - on 1st July I reported overhanging trees on the A435 where the Gloucestershire Way crosses West (from Coberley) East towards Upper Coberley - your reference 11461593. On 9th July you closed this case because you were planning to cut the verges during the week beginning 29th July. I can confirm that verge cutting happened on Saturday 3rd August and, surprise surprise, the issue remains! It is still dangerous to cross the road because of overhanging trees and cars still cannot see me (mainly because I always was &amp;gt;2ft tall....). I attach before and after photos and as you can see, it is impossible to see oncoming cars until it is far too late. I have nearly been hit on numerous occasions as I cross this road daily. I cannot see or hear cars as they drive south from Cheltenham. Someone is going to be killed, and statistically it is likely to be me as I cross this road every single day! Note - the warning sign that has a person and horse on it has been knocked over and is hidden by grass (I can&amp;#39;t take a photo of that as it is impossible to get to it on foot). With the A417 roadworks (made doubly worse by the fact that Leckhampton Hill has now been closed), we have a lot of drivers unfamiliar with the area. This is likely why they shake their fists at me when they become aware of me 1/2 way across the road as I take my life into my own hands hoping there is no one coming - they have no idea that there is a public footpath. Cars swerve into the oncoming traffic when they become aware of a pedestrian using the Gloucestershire Way perfectly legally. I have no idea how the riders/people on horseback cope. They must be absolutely terrified. I appreciate that you cannot impose a speed limit or add a pedestrian crossing, but honestly, why can&amp;#39;t you sort out the overhanging trees?? Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6318707.0.jpeg?fc9759bd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road, Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6318707&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>General road marking and stud issues problem, 5th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6318410</link>
<description>02/08/24 email rcvd, diagram attached - Hello Highways,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Again, this is one I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to propose to you but kept forgetting !&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Would you consider painting white &amp;#39;ahead&amp;#39; &amp;amp; &amp;#39;right turn&amp;#39; arrows on the TWO lanes on College Road, northbound to Hewlett Road, just before the pedestrian crossing, to clarify that the new right lane can be used to turn right ? &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since the lane delineation markings are currently all centre line style, as one approaches northbound, it can be confusing as to which lane is for which flow of traffic - on first appearance northbound, there are three lanes all with the same markings, and if there is no oncoming traffic, a driver might be confused into thinking they can use all three (and not only the two on the left). &amp;#10;&amp;#10;I&amp;#39;d suggest that the style of line between lanes one and two northbound are changed to shorter lines to denote two lanes within the one northbound driving lane. But I imagine this was not done originally as the lines are too close to the pedestrian crossing, and therefore need to be the longer &amp;#39;hazard&amp;#39; style of centre line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So I was wondering if you&amp;#39;d consider a straight ahead arrow in lane one northbound, a right turn arrow in lane two northbound, and possible an opposing straight ahead arrow in lane one southbound ? Please see the rendered pic to illustrate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you feel this is unnecessary, I&amp;#39;d be interested to learn why this would be the case.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to hearing from you soon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards,&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6318410&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
