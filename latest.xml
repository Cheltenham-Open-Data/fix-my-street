<title>There seems to be some damage/hole next to a drainhole cover and the kerbstone has become dislodged., 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5372166</link>
<description>The damage is outside number 94. The kerbstone has become loose and seems to have been pushed upwards. There is a small hole in the road next to the drain/cover but I cannot see what damage is underneath and whether there is any damage to the drainage which is in very close proximity to the kerbstone/small hole. The kerbstone needs to be refixed and any damage investigated.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5372166.0.jpeg?f381a3f9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Laynes Road, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5372166&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water gushing from manhole cover, 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5371394</link>
<description>Drain is outside The Old Bovey on Farm Lane, Shurdington. Severn Trent Water have inspected it but say it’s a blocked flood drain and not their responsibility. Water is gushing out very fast and flowing into the drain in the Main Road but that has issues of blocking so Main Road might become dangerous.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5371394.0.jpeg?8897b5f4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Farm Lane, Shurdington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5371394&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Broken drain cover and hole., 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5370570</link>
<description>This issue has been reported and repaired however, overnight the repair has been smashed out by traffic. The hole is now worse than the original problem. The hole is down to the concrete, well over 75mm. It is causing noise, which disturbs sleep in the adjacent properties. The drain cover is loose and not fixed in place any more. The drain is still blocked (although reported). It needs immediate repair. Although I would request it is repaired properly this time.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5370570.0.jpeg?f4d12709&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5370570&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Abandoned trolley, 30th December</title>

<description>Trolley has been here for several days. I had an auto response from TBC saying that it wasn&amp;#39;t in their area, I&amp;#39;m aware of that - normally FMS sends direct to CBC, so not sure why it was sent to TBC this time. Either way the trolley is still there...&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Yeend Close, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5369240&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole on bend - junction of Birdlip Road &amp; Aggs Hill, 30th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5369200</link>
<description>I recently reported a number of potholes and was informed that they had been fixed (enquiry number 22034889), however the worst/deepest one has not been fixed - see photos taken earlier this pm. It is so deep it goes through a number of layers of road. Because it is situated on the bend it is not visible to traffic until the last second and looks deep enough to damage a wheel. It seems to me that it was not repaired when it should have been under enquiry 22034889?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5369200.0.jpeg?6405899f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Aggs Hill, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5369200&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
