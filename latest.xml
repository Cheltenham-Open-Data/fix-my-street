<title>Very loose paving slab with no support or surround, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4111065</link>
<description>This is one of a number of paving slabs that have been damaged on the pedestrianised section of the Promenade in Cheltenham, close to House of Fraser. Others have been repaired quickly and efficiently but this one is very loose and is a potential trip hazard.

<title>Potholes across Road, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4108680</link>
<description>The location is the Cleeve Common Road just past the entrance to the Old Quarry / Dry Pool Farm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two potholes have opened up - one either side of the road and right in the vehicle wheel tracks such that it is impossible to miss them. The road between the potholes also seems to be braking up to form a shallow &amp;#39;trench&amp;#39;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can these be filled in such that it stops the holes reopening as quite a few vehicles use this road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Cleeve Common, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4108680&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>2 large pot holes, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4107870</link>
<description>Large pot holes outside number 6 and number 8 Linworth Road. The holes are that deep there is a lot of debris left over the road which keeps hitting our vehicles. These have been there since before Christmas but everytime they are filled they come out a few weeks later. This is by a school so the traffic is really bad and is causing a lot of damage now. We shouldnâ€™t have to keep sweeping the pavement/road everyday. The road is bad and then flicks the stones up at my car and then it covered the pavement which is going to do a school child an injury sooner or later. Please sort&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 8 Linworth Road, Bishops Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4107870&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Stay Left Bollard no longer bolted down, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4103813</link>
<description>The Stay Left Bollard protecting the crossing outside the Smith and Mann shop on Lyefield Road East with a blue arrow was knocked over approximately a year ago. It is the type where the bolts are designed to break on impact, it may be possible to replace the bolts without replacing the entire bollard and base. The brand name on it is &amp;quot;Visaboll&amp;quot; as in the photos. It is a thin and lightweight bollard and without the bolts when the wind blows it falls over.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4103813.0.png?12808e51&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 66 Copt Elm Road, Charlton Kings&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4103813&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Wrong road marking!!!! needs to be solid line, 8th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4100509</link>
<description>On this section of the road after the Kilkeney In as you go towards Gloucester the road markings are wrong, it should not be interrupted line but a continuous solid line as there is no visibility and it is dangerous to overtake. Once I was driving relaxed towards Gloucester in the evening and suddenly when I reached this curve someone from opposite direction engaged in overtaking and appeared straight in front of me. Luckily he managed to get partly back into his lane and I managed to go over the roadside grass and we avoided front head on collision. So the other party relied that the road markings interrupted line are accurate and safe and he used them as guidance, but he did not realise because there is no visibility on this section the road the markings are wrong and needs updating URGENTLY to solid line PLEASE. Thank you!!! The purpose of the road markings and the road signs are to ensure the traffic and the road users are safe if they respect them, but needs to be accurate and realistic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): A436, Andoversford&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4100509&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
