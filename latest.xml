<description>The location is on a blind bend on the left hand side going up Aggs Hill. A pothole and with the recent rain the edge of the road has been washed out causing a deep gully which could cause problems if a vehicle went too far to the side of the road while passing. In the same general location there is another pothole which is causing vehicles coming down the hill to swerve to miss it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can these be repaired&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Aggs Hill, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4667583&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Subsoil subsidence under tarmac on Edge of Public Footpath / Road, 13th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4667543</link>
<description>The location is Ham Lane. A relatively small hole was discovered at the location and reported to Water / Sewage Company who advised it was a Highways issue and they may have reported it already. However, the hole has gotten larger and with the problem being on a main turning point in the lane as well as around a series of drain pipes - the heavy weight of vans turning could well cause collapse of the road into as hole. A rod was put in the hole and several feet disappeared with little feel of having reached a bottom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can this be repaired as soon as possible as the footpath and the road are well used.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4667543.0.jpeg?d40ebf51&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ham Lane, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4667543&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tone bag of gravel dumped, 13th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4666023</link>
<description>I tried to reply to your email but it wouldn’t let me. Here is another dumped 1 ton of random gravel from Morgan Supplies. Like the other one reported by KFC on Bristol Road, Morgan Supplies are dumping these 1 ton bags around Gloucester to illegally advertise. They need to be removed. They are nothing to do with road works or improvements, they are just put there purely for advertisements&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4666023&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
