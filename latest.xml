<title>Noisy manhole outside our 241 London Road home in cheltenham, 10th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573790</link>
<description>Dear Highways,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This noisy manhole cover and frame outside our 241 London Road home has been repaired again by Severn Trent last month and failed within days. In fact this last repair has made it worse. it’s a disgrace and not fair on all of us who live near it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four years, four failed Severn Trent repairs and the saga still goes on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They are not carrying out the repair correctly and I keep telling them the frame must be properly sat on engineer bricks and then concrete hauching around the frame, before covering with Tarmac.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you please liaise with Severn Trent and ensure the next repair is carried out properly asap.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 239b, London Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573790&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Repeating flooding Mill Lane, 10th October</title>

<description>Highway drains have not been cleared after last storm and so flooding has re-occurred. Please send crew to clear the highway drains and pump away water. Environment Agency report it is NOT river -borne flooding, but inadequate road drainage maintenance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6573722.0.jpeg?21ebcc82&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mill Lane, Stoke Orchard, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573722&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drain in the gutter of the road, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573518</link>
<description>There is a drain in the road just by the dropped kerb to our house (number 64). The drain fills up and water flows down the street and onto the pavement when it rains, as the water can’t drain away properly. People suffer from flooding further down the hill so it’s not good that water run off here isn’t getting into the sewer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The next day after the water has finally drained away, you can see leaves and soil in the base of the drain. I think it’s blocked by tree roots and soil.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 64, Brooklyn Road, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573518&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water gushes out of this drain whenever it rains heavily, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573348</link>
<description>More water comes out of this drain than goes into it. Something is clearly wrong here and it just cascades down the hill and overwhelms the drains downstream. You can see from the first picture that little water enters the drain from above so it looks like the water is coming from the adjacent field. The second photo shows how the drains further down get overwhelmed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6573348.0.jpeg?86ac4ec5&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Gloucester Road, Andoversford, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6573348&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic lights do not turn red for pedestrians in timely manner, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6572831</link>
<description>Normally one waits 25-30 seconds for lights to turn red when the button is pressed. Most people have given up and walked across the road before lights turn red for traffic. Frustrating for cars and pedestrians!!. For example at the pedestrian lights outside Cheltenham college the lights turn red almost immediately the button pressed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): College Road, Tivoli, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6572831&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Still floods every time it rains, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6572365</link>
<description>This outside my Mum’s house at 67 Boverton Drive, she has severe mobility issues and this creates a big problem for her getting from her front gate and into my car. This has been reported several times before and I am not happy with the previous response (‘planned maintenance’ etc) without a clear timescale. This was nearly a year ago. Please advise when this will be rectified. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6572365.0.jpeg?286b14f6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 72, Boverton Drive, Brockworth, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6572365&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Hi Liam, We already reported this and you have come out but I just wanted to see if any chance this could be expedited as real risk of further flooding to our house again -interior.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just wanted to flag up that yesterday the water came really high again- up to half way up the wooden flood barrier- luckily my mother in law was here with the kids as we were both working and she put the flood barriers up and undug the leaves from the drain which helped a bit and the water didn’t get into the house. I appreciate you must be really busy but if there is any way it could be done as soon as possible we would be really grateful. Living in fear of it flooding every time we are working and it’s heavy rain! If there is anything else I can do to help our case- reporting it anywhere else or whatever- please let me know.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you very much,&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Vineyards Lane, Alstone, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571888&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The sign is illegible problem, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571684</link>
<description>I recently went through a two-year process with the council and an insurance company about subsidence in my property. The tree at the front of the house which is on the pavement and outside my boundary was put on notice and subsequently &amp;#39;uneven pavement&amp;#39; signs have been put outside my house. These signs are leading to the following things; &amp;#10;•&amp;#9;They impede the off-road parking for properties. The signs are subsequently moved continuously either onto my front garden or against my wall. &amp;#10;•&amp;#9;There have been multiple occasions where the signs have blown over with cars driving across them.&amp;#10;•&amp;#9;As temporary and unstable signs they are a trip hazard in addition to the pavement itself. &amp;#10;As the pavements are clearly in enough disrepair to warrant signs, please could you confirm what the council intends to do to mitigate the problem? I have seen multiple people trip on the damage to the pavement caused by tree roots damage. Last year I also flagged that the root damage causes large puddles which seem also to be filling from the ground, rather than in heavy rain weather conditions. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please let me know when I can expect to hear back. &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571684&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
