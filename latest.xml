<title>Missing slab not fixed causing obstruction, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5544681</link>
<description>It’s on the path of Lobley’s Drive next to Stearman Walk path not far from the traffic lights. I believe it’s probably already been reported however as for someone who uses a pushchair I can’t pass this area and crossing the road to go around isn’t easy with a push chair. It’s been like this for months. It would be nice for it to finally be fixed to make passing much easier.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Beamont Walk, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5544681&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cars keep parking across this dropped kerb opposite my house, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5543931</link>
<description>When asked if they happen to be leaving (as the road is narrow and it creates problems entering or exiting my driveway) they become rude and combatitive. I have tried to suggest that they are in breach of the highway code, as though the council have allowed them to pay for the kerb to be dropped, the land does not in fact belong to them (or their mother who is the one I believe lives there) they insist it&amp;#39;s their dropped kerb and they can do what they like, and become rude and aggressive. I have tried to broach the topic politely, and asked if they couldn&amp;#39;t park just opposite on the road, like every one else, and they suggested everyone else parked legally around my driveway was at fault instead and I should pay to have with widenend (which I can&amp;#39;t as it&amp;#39;s a housing association home) I am disabled with regular carers, and a young child. There&amp;#39;s no public transport here and we are not near any shops when considering autistic children/adults and need to use a wheelchair. Access in and out of my drive is vital and I am not having any luck asking nicely if things could change.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5543931.0.jpeg?852ee392&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pillcroft Road, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5543931&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
