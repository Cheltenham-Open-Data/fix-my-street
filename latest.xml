<title>The entire strip off road is covered in deep potholes, 15th December</title>

<description>The road leading to home farm and 2 other property’s leading from Brockhampton lane is completely covered in deep potholes and has been getting progressively worse over the past couple of years I myself have had 1 tyre repair and one tyre replacement due to the road being so bad and is only fit to drive 5mph. This road is used by lots of caravans as a business and holds horses and other live stock and it’s very uneven and unsafe for the trailers towing them. Please can you confirm when you will be able to review and repair this section of road as it’s not fit to high safety standards thank you I look to your reply&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockhampton Lane, Kingsditch, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5325934&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Parking on the path, 15th December</title>

<description>This is opposite the grangfield school in bishops cleeve. People park there damaging the grass and leaving it all horrible and muddy. Also I live on the Highgrove and Cars parked there completely block the view when trying to pull up to main road. I nearly had car crash. Maybe metal barriers will prevent people from parking.
