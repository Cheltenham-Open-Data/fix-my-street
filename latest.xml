<title>Faded white H lines, 21st September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5019138</link>
<description>The lines were installed to provide safety for those using the public footpath Prestbury church/Southam, and to prevent blocking of access to residential homes in Shaw Green Lane. Since 18/07/2023 refreshment of the much faded lines has been repeatedly requested to Highways and Byways and the appropriate form submitted. To date no action has been taken. The lines have faded due to increased heavy traffic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 65, Shaw Green Lane, Prestbury, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5019138&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overgrown hedges obscuring view of traffic, 20th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5015688</link>
<description>The bushes along the footpath on Hatherley Road just beyond the Hatherley Gate and before Hatherley Court Gardens are overgrown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A resident who has tried to cut them back reported finding drugs paraphernalia in the undergrowth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also, the bushes limit the view for drivers turning out of Hatherley Gate. This means that cars coming from the left, along Hatherley Road, only come into view when they are quite close to Hatherley Court Road making it dangerous when turning right onto Hatherley Road going towards Lansdown Road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I understand that these bushes are on land that is the responsibility of CBC.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5015688.0.jpeg?920d5887&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hatherley Gate, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5015688&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement damgerous for wheelchairs, 20th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5013600</link>
<description>An elderly neighbour uses a 6 wheel wheelchair (2-2-2) to navigate the pavements of Benhall, but he fears getting round this corner. There is an exposed tree root and several raised slabs. His 4-wheeled wheelchair couldn&amp;#39;t take this corner without tipping up. His current wheelchair can do it, but it&amp;#39;s quite a hair-raising experience for a hemiplegic 80something year old.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5013600.0.jpeg?5be93c0f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 50, Farmington Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5013600&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
