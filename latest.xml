<title>Occupant of property 34 Devon Avenue admitted rubbish belongs to them., 10th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3816212</link>
<description>Location of fly tipping is in front garden of 1 Somerset Avenue - Mrs XXXXXXXX (recently deceased council tenants house). Some post found in the rubbish had address 34 Devon Avenue on it - naming occupants XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX (envelopes photographed for evidence). They (occupants 34 Devon Avenue) inclusive of a XXXXXXXX (also believed to live at the address - fiancé to XXXXXXXX) claim to have paid 2 local lads £60 to dispose of the rubbish. After confronting them a few days ago they said they would clear it up. Someone filled 3 bin liners and placed in a hired skip on the property and also filled the council bin (that had been cleaned ready to lock away in the property as property is in the process of being handed back to the council). They however made no further effort in clearing the mess up (photo&amp;#39;s available). We contacted them again (Friday 9 Sept 22) and were assured by XXXXXXXX (Filmed evidence) that he would immediately sort it out. On checking again today Sat 10 Sep 22 the rubbish (inclusive glass) still remain scattered over the front garden.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/3816212.0.jpeg?8705cc84&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 1 Somerset Avenue, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3816212&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fibreoptics work causing chaos, 7th September</title>

<description>Badly positioned traffic lights and lack of measures to ensure junctions are kept clear of parked cars has led to stand offs between vehicles travelling towards each other and I&amp;#39;ve witnessed minor road rage incidents. Car trying to turn into roads off Hesters Way Rd cannot get into those roads due to vehicles waiting to get out. I didn&amp;#39;t witness peak time this morning with the schools being back but it was pretty bad at 9.30am! Better planning is needed!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 117 Hester&#39;s Way Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3810026&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
