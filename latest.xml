<title>Potholes broken &amp; sunken road surface 2, 10th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5832237</link>
<description>You&amp;#39;ve reported as fixed today ? - but - you&amp;#39;ve done more work in the middle section of Malden Rd &amp;amp; nothing in the top section as requested (&amp;amp; described) in the original report? The original request still stands:The road surface has seriously deteriorated along the length of Malden Road (section nearest to the the Pump Room) and multiple potholes have developed. The road has also sunk along one side and surface has broken up causing a hazard. I turned an ankle last week. A small number of potholes have been marked for repair recently, however, as can be seen from the photos attached they are only a small number &amp;amp; ignore the multiple &amp;amp; massive sunken areas adjacent that collect water &amp;amp; continue to degrade the surface. It is clear the road needs levelling &amp;amp; resurfacing along the length - as has been completed in the adjacent middle section of Malden Road which was previously in a better state of repair that this? A short term fix to &amp;#39;patch&amp;#39; those marked will only result in further work in a very short space of time. Many Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5832237.0.jpeg?64e93113&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 70, Malden Road, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5832237&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Complete failure of road surface, 9th April</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5831301</link>
<description>Long stretch between Prestbury Road &amp;amp; Cromwell Road. In areas it is causing dangerous vehicle evasive action. The surface deterioration is very wide in areas and the original concrete road surface is visible. Considering the road was resurfaced in the last 15 years this is unacceptable and needs to be rectified urgently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5831301.0.jpeg?1540a942&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 256, Priors Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5831301&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
