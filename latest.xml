<title>There are a large collection of signs and barriers that we used when the council marked out the Z15 parking zones. The yhave not moved since mid September save when drunk people block to the road with them. This happened last night at North hall mews and some have been carried further down the road to the top of All Saints Road. I have not retrieved these as they are 100 meters away. Is there any chance they could be collected?, 17th December</title>

<description>At the junction of North Hall Mews (GL52 2QD) and Pittville Circus Road. There are some barriers at the junction of All Saints Road and Pittville Circus Road now as well.
