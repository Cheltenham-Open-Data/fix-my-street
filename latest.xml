<description>The traffic lights on the crossroads of two hedges Rd, Cheltenham Rd and Voxwell Ln have the pedestrian button constantly illuminated this evening.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The traffic lights are allowing one direction of traffic through before beeping for pedestrian crossing.

<title>Insufficient drainage, owing to agricultural runoff in heavy rain and this drain being lowest point before watercourse, 8th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6953422</link>
<description>The drain that backs up is outside of 3 Mill Corner, however the main issue is the insufficient drainage from agricultural fields adjacent to Witcombe village hall. For the past few years, when there is heavy rain if any kind, the silt and water runoff fills all drains en route to the aforementioned drain at the lowest point, causing more water flow than the drain can deal with. This has, on a number of occasions put the properties of 3 and 4 Mill Corner at risk of flooding.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mill Corner, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6953422&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A deep pothole on the carriageway, 8th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6952601</link>
<description>The pothole is on Cleeve Road travelling towards Gotherington from Bishops Cleeve. It is a very deep pothole that has been there for nearly two months which is likely to cause significant damage to all types of road vehicles and their drivers, especially at night as there is no street lighting to help road users see it. I hit this pothole square on this afternoon and I&amp;#39;ve never experienced an impact like it. I will have to have my suspension and steering inspected to ensure they have not been damaged or misaligned. The co-ordinates for the pothole are - 51.961, -2.054.
