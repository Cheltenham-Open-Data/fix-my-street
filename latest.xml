<title>Unsafe tree on the corner of West Drive Cheltenham. GL50 4LB, 25th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7183453</link>
<description>Dear Sir/Madam, I have sent this email to various departments over the past two months without getting through to the correct one, so hopefully ðŸ¤žI have now reached the correct one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could I please point out to you that I reported the instability of this tree to your team back in July 2020.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Possibly one of the reasons for the instability of this tree, could be a collapsed drain. My main sewer exits my property adjacent to this tree under my wall. As you will see from the photographs I have supplied, not only is my wall leaning (it has definitely moved since I last reported the tree to you), but there is also a growing dip where water now accumulates causing quite a large puddle on the footpath. This too has become larger since I reported the issue to you back in 2020. (I believe I supplied photographs to you back then as well).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you were to trace back and look into your records, there was a large tree removed due to honey fungus more or less where you planted this replacement tree. The original tree had extremely large roots, one of which grew under my wall at this very point and chose to show itself in my lawn. Iâ€™m wondering (as itâ€™s possibly too much of a coincidence) that this particular root damaged the waste pipe causing the pipe to fracture (I believe it is of ceramic type). Secondly as the root decayed, together with a collapsed pipe, caused subsidence to my wall. I also have subsidence in my lawn where the root used to be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Perhaps, together with Severn Trent Water you could investigate this together. The above might well be the reason for the instability of this tree.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I stress again his tree must be removed. If we were to have another storm the ferocity we had recently, this tree would very likely be uprooted. If you look at the photograph of the base of the tree, you will observe evidence of the movement this tree&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7183453.0.jpeg?d3d788e9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): West Drive, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7183453&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>What on earth is going on with this bit of road and pavement?, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7183158</link>
<description>I floods due to blocked or damaged drainage. Its not finished from the retarmacing that was done last year. Its a Safety Hazard. The council need to get out there with an inspector and put a plan together to sort it. I heard it was being discussed by solicitors. Its needs sorting, not discussing! Sure the repair would be better than paying solicitors?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gretton Road, Gotherington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7183158&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Slope at end of footpath on Hunters Road to Stoke Road It has been ages since first reported, someone put fresh tarmac on it. Slope just as bad if not worse now, the road leading to footpath is full of potholes, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7182811</link>
<description>Footpath is along the fence to the houses in Hunters road, the trees were cut down two years ago so the foot path could be dug and made more accessible. Someone has chucked some tarmac on it and made the slope even less accessible, canâ€™t go there with a walking frame or a buggy. Why is taxpayers money given to cowboys . Please make good repair so us elderly can use the footpath again. And remove the plastic guards left there for a couple of years.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7182811.0.jpeg?fa555b6b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 12A,14,15,16, Hunters Road, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7182811&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>This whole stretch of rd is littered with potholes, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7182648</link>
<description>This is a complaint covering the whole area of this rd both sides as there are huge holes going up Leckhampton hill and before and after Ullenwood junction coming from Birdlip. I use this rd twice a dayâ€¦ one driver sat outside car this morning visibly upset with a burst tyre and another one this afternoon in same place with RAC helping with burst tyre. I just cannot believe you can leave this rd in this awful, dangerous condition, holes are always patched up and due to weather this weekend, they are all open again and treacherous, a situation that has been going on for months and monthsâ€¦ the rd was shut for 1.5 months in Sept 24 why cd this road not be replaced properly then? Lives are in danger on this road and I dread my morning and eve commutes along this road everyday. Have never witnessed anything like it in 40 years of driving and it makes me feel very sad.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Leckhampton Hill, Shurdington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7182648&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
