<title>Not mended! Temporary traffic lights have been in place for weeks and your website says it is mended, 19th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6374167</link>
<description>This is an ongoing major defect in the road, and I checked on here to see when it was scheduled to be dealt with. I see you appear to have signed it off as complete. There are temporary traffic lights, a 30 mph restriction in both directions (entirely unnecessary northbound once you are past the defect) and a sense of permanence and stagnation around the whole thing. This butts straight onto the hideous collection of barriers which basically obscure the view at the racecourse roundabout. I feel this is now something of an embarrassment for the council and am surprised (am I?) that there seems to be a lack of dynamism to get this sorted out.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Evesham Road, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6374167&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 19th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6373558</link>
<description>FMS rcvd 19.08.24 - Overhanging tree very close to house. A tree outside No 2 Robert Burns Avenue which is getting very close to the house with overhanging branches. Estimate it to be within 6-8 feet of the building. There are numerous trees in the road but none of them are anywhere near the adjoining houses. The branches are blocking natural light and this week a squirrel jump from the tree onto the roof of the house, Without being addressed the situation is obviously only going to get worse so could some of these branches trimmed back please.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6373558&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This is how the footpath outside my driveway was left after the verge was mown this morning. Please remind operators to take the time to clear footpaths in future so that people do not have to trudge through grass cuttings. There was also a pile of grass cuttings left in the road further down Noverton Avenue which I did not take a photograph of but which also demonstrated the lack of care taken this morning by the operator.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6373278.0.jpeg?2c113011&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 18, Noverton Avenue, Noverton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6373278&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
