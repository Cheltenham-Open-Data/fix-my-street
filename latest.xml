<title>Northbound from Stow Court to Malvern Road, 23rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5246585</link>
<description>The north bound section from aproximately Stow Court to Malvern road is absolutely lethal for cyclists. Riding on the left hand side anywhere near the kerb is dangerous due to the current pot holes, the previous bad patching of pot holes and bad resurfacing. Please have someone attempt the ride on a cycle to experience it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 169, Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5246585&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No dropped curb! Canâ€™t use in wheelchair, 23rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5246490</link>
<description>This street, and many others of North Upton Lane do not have drop curbs, and therefore I cannot travel on my wheelchair from Abbeymead to Hucclecote. It is very frustrating when, in this day and age, there are not drop curbs on roads. I have a new wheelchair, but I feel I cannot go out as most of the pavements are inaccessible to me.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5246490.0.jpeg?3e33e8e9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): North Upton Lane, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5246490&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Continual Flooding of Leckhampton road footpath, 23rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5244876</link>
<description>I notice today that you are putting in a new surface on the path in Mornington Drive, which is little used, but nothing is done along Leckhampton road, from approx Halland Road to the Norwood. When it rains it&amp;#39;s now virtually impossible to walk along the path and you either have to cross the road or walk in the road. I know its difficult as the path is below the road, and it has lots of tree roots, and you have cleaned some drains, but its beyond a joke and needs a solution before somebody gets knocked down walking on the road. I have sent a selection of photos which I took in the summer, but can send more as it happens every time we get more than drizzle.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5244876.0.jpeg?8ff12052&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 63, Leckhampton Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5244876&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
