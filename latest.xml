<title>2x streetlights on public walkway not working, 15th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5216045</link>
<description>The public walkway that runs alongside the A417 beside Barnwood Point has two unlit streetlights. Due to being on the other side of a tall hedge next to the A417 with street lights, this path is very shaded and dark in the afternoons/evenings. There isn&amp;#39;t currently any light being provided to the walkway.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5216045.0.jpeg?2a756cd6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Corinium Avenue, Barnwood, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5216045&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Good afternoon, I am writing in connection with the state of (what used to be) the pavement as above, which has been cordoned off by a barrier since about July this year. This is presumably because of the instability of the wall of the property adjoining (St Ives Court) and danger to the public from falling masonry. However, no remedial action has been taken during all these months, and everyone passing is forced to walk over what used to be the grass verge, which is now reduced to soft mud. There is just as much danger from slipping on this as there is from falling masonry. The photo attached shows the state of the pavement. Either the wall needs to be repaired soonest, or the grass verge paved over to provide a safe space to walk. I’d be grateful to know what action can be taken here. As I live in Marston Road, I have no option but to use this pavement as I turn to walk south down Albert Road. Regards, 15th November</title>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 15th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5214358</link>
<description>email rcvd 14.11.23 - l was wondering if someone could help me as I have a few concerns regarding our recent purchase of property regarding a tree that is in the pavement outside of our property. These are starting with the highest concern;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tree appears to be growing fibreous roots into our drainage system(which is also the responsibility of the council/severn trent water to maintain), the drains were cleared before our ownership but our drainage inspection raised it as an ongoing concern as did our homeowners survey(which is when we were made aware of the blockage). &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Second to this I do worry about it being so close to the property &amp;amp; it over hanging the roofline as it could cause damage to the property if it came down. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Further to this there&amp;#39;s obviously the frustration of having a garden completely full of leaves &amp;amp; birds using our vehicle paint work as target practice(I&amp;#39;m sure you know what I mean). &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any help on this would be great. Ideally we would either like the tree removed or at least cut back to possibly mediate these issues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5214358&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5214356</link>
<description>FMS rcvd 10.11.23 - Please take action regarding the large overgrown tress at the top of Leckhampton road, the branches are dropping from a height which can harm pedestrians. The trees are so large, they are covering the lamp posts which are not lighting up the pavement in the dark. The leaves are all over the pavements, please get the men to clear leaves up regularly. Also it makes the pavements slippery when wet when leaves and puddles are present. Issue with lots of uneven pavements on Leckhampton Road. What height do you intend the trees to reach before they are cut back ? 3 times the height of the houses? Some of the tree trunks are so large you can’t walk on the pavements.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5214356&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
