<description>When travelling towards Bournside from Morrisons, there is a pothole on the left side of the road near the kerb between the bollards.

<title>The entire length of Caernarvon Road!!!, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5536066</link>
<description>The entire length of this road is shocking to say the least. Multiple potholes, multiple patchwork repairs failing, Speed humps are like driving over kerbs. How many more times does this need reporting before proper action takes place?!! Maybe when you&amp;#39;re done resurfacing the more affluent areas you&amp;#39;ll give this road the attention it so desperately needs......I won&amp;#39;t hold my breath though as this saga has been ongoing for years!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 129, Caernarvon Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5536066&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Vehicle blocking public access - not the first time, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5535984</link>
<description>Vehicles regularly blocking the shared path on the Honeybourne line. Workers responsible were discovered near waitrose bridge, so no excuse for blocking access where they were. This happens also with the sub station parking on the path too. It&amp;#39;s frustrating negotiating bad and inconsiderate parking in Cheltenham.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5535984.0.jpeg?8a78c4a7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Honeybourne, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5535984&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic over lip in road causing substantial house shaking, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5534312</link>
<description>Road outside Proper House Leckhampton Lane since resurfacing end last year, any fast vehicles or heavy goods lorries clip some kind of ridge which now makes our house shake quite considerably and wakes us at night, which never happened before. Coincidentally since vibrations started, we had to replace water pipes near the site at our own expense which may have been exacerbated by vibrations from the road, &amp;amp; we worry other infrastructure could also be affected.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 4, Leckhampton Lane, Shurdington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5534312&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
