<description>Near to the new housing estate being build, loads of potholes &amp;amp; surface damage on the bends approaching the estate in both directions.- loads of craters in the road making it unavoidable not to hit one ! 1 section of awful road near pilgrive way has been resurfaced but this area has been left untouched !! Driving from Churchdown to Cheltenham &amp;amp; back again. This needs resurfacing as now a danger to drive on ! How highway inspections can say this road is ok is unbelievable.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Old Gloucester Road, Springbank, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5467786&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Pedestrian crossing near the Co op Hewlett Road. On Numerous occasions I have witnessed drivers not stopping at the red light. It is mostly traffic approaching the roundabout.

<title>Issue with Highways claiming an issue fixed., 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5467051</link>
<description>I have reported issues with this road twice now, and each time the Highways department has reported the problem has been fixed when it hasn&amp;#39;t. This should be investigated as updating an issue as fixed when it isn&amp;#39;t is surely a serious offence. Here&amp;#39;s the issue that has just been cleared by the authorities ... NOTE - THIS ROAD PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. Sent to Gloucestershire County Council less than a minute later. FixMyStreet ref: 5420573.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Appalling potholed and damaged road surface over an extended area along the busy Priors Road from Prestbury Road all the way along to the junction with Bouncers Lane. This surface has been awful for many months after being reported. Some half-hearted attempt was made to patch some of it up - but it&amp;#39;s now worse than ever again.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 271, Priors Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5467051&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Poor road markings, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5466969</link>
<description>The road markings on this crossway / junction are confusing and a hazard. As I travelled along Gotherington Lane, I had to do an emergency stop as a vehicle came out to the left of me. We were both very lucky - next time we may not be so lucky! Why does the most used lane not have priority here and why is this not just a normal junction??? It is very confusing and totally in appropriate. This needs urgent attention before there is a serious accident. The chicanes that precede it also need looking at. The distance is too long and on a bend most people are ignoring the wait. Once the hedge has leaves there will be even less visibility.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gotherington Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5466969&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
