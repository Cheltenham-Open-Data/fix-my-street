<title>Water runs across the road and freezes in cold conditions, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5426230</link>
<description>Water continuously runs across the road and this becomes black ice in freezing conditions. This road is not lit in the early morning or night so this ice can be difficult to see. I noticed a car had come off the road this morning/last night and hit a tree on my way up there today. It can be very dangerous in the winter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dowdeswell, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5426230&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>On the Hucclecote Road, travelling towards Gloucester, but before the M5 bridge. It is beyond the turning to Bird Road and yes it has painted lines but I am fed up with trying to report this problem. I must inform you that having told you of this problem if I hear or learn of a cyclist being involved in an accident at this point I will report you to the relevant authorities. This is a very dangerous pothole for cyclists of which I am one. Finally this website is so difficult to use and as I type out this message I can only see the last few words which again is indicative of a poorly designed website . If you wish to call me to discuss this my telephone number is (01452) 611614., 10th January</title>

<description>Hucclecote Road going into Gloucester before the M5 bridge. The pothole is beyond the turning to bird Road. I have to say that this process has been very time-consuming and the cynic in me says that this is deliberate to ensure that people do not report these problems. They simply give up because of the time taken.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5425788.0.jpeg?67c2d052&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Road, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5425788&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bad road markings, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5424883</link>
<description>Cars exiting old Gloucester Road wanting to go straight on, cut across traffic turning right and on a number of occasions have nearly come in contact with each other in the centre of the junction. I feel this could easily be remedied by changing the left-hand lane to just left, and the right hand lane to straight on and turn right, so traffic uses one lane for both directions&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5424883.0.jpeg?55563a27&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5424883&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
