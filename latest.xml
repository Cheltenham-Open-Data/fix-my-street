<title>Inadequate No Through Road sign needs replacing, 20th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5603905</link>
<description>At the entrance to Lansdown Terrace Lane on the corner. Nobody realises it is a dead end because the sign is so old/rusty and now covered by Estate Agent boards. Continual traffic zooms up the lane and no decent turning places. A new sign making it clear would help the problem. Sign must be 40 years old!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5603905.0.jpeg?6eb9d254&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lansdown Terrace Lane, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5603905&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 20th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5604214</link>
<description>Good afternoon&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At 5.15am this morning I was driving down North Road West when I went down a massive pothole. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;It shook my car really badly and I had to stop and look around the car as I thought I had caused damage. I now have a knocking noise when I turn the wheel which I didn&amp;#39;t have before. The impact even made my dash air freshener pop off which is glued on. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;On my way home I stopped to take the picture attached. 2 workmen there said a supervisor was in his way as they couldn&amp;#39;t patch it and the road needs shutting and a bigger patch putting in. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;What&amp;#39;s the next steps as my car is now damaged as a result of this pothole. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Regards &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5604214&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
