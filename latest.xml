<title>Temporary lights in place for NO apparent reason, 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185726</link>
<description>Junction of Cirencester Road and Bafford Approach. I presume the Cirencester to Gloucester road may be shut again this evening and the London road in Charlton Kings may be shut again this evening and the temporary lights on the Cirencester Road have been left in place but there is NO obstruction in the road and there is a long tailback! Can we shut or cause unnecessary delays on any more roads to the south of Cheltenham at the same time?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Bafford Approach, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185726&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous complicated junction layout, 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185642</link>
<description>Junction with Vale Road and Mirabelle Road is dangerous. I drove across from Mirabelle Road this afternoon, two cars approaching from Gotherington drove straight across in front of me, across my right of way. I had to stop to avoid collisions. You need to change this junction before an accident happens Turning right from Vale Road has poor visibility from the left because bushes have been left there, obscuring view of approaching traffic The Road sign (approaching from Station Road) shows you have priority but there is a give way sign there and priority is on Mirabelle Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 22, Sharing Grove, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185642&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unauthorised parking restrictions, 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185466</link>
<description>There is on road parking (i.e. slightly wider road) outside the small parade of shops on Blacksmith Lane. There is a standard blue and white parking time restriction sign and there is zero evidence that the parking is private land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The newsagent is displaying prominent &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot; signs in his window that the &amp;quot;parking is only for customers&amp;quot; and that he has CCTV watching them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I believe that this is an illegal attempt to apply parking restrictions to a public highway and threaten the public through the &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot; written in his signs and the threat of CCTV being used.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 4, Blacksmith Lane, Churchdown, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185466&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bollards, 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185091</link>
<description>Bollards that appear to have been installed to prevent pavement parking/driving for motor vehicles near the flats have made the cycle path more dangerous and almost unusable. The pathway is already very narrow and putting bollards either side is an accident waiting to happen. Its too narrow for cyclists to pass each other when going in opposite directions! Please correct.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 321, Princess Elizabeth Way, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5185091&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>New fence is on lane not owned by home owner but on lane., 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5184137</link>
<description>Spring Lane GL523PY House has erected fence onto lane past property wall/boundary. The landgrab has damaged high fibre internet cable buried there by gigaclear. They have cut two trees that were there, again on lane not their land, and planted new ones. All of this done in last three weeks. The cable will have to be relaid where cars park alongside the fence. Gigaclear asked who owned the land I said highways to best of my knowledge they said to call it in. Obviously they had permission to lay this.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5184137.0.jpeg?1b06c927&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Spring Lane, Southam, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5184137&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>More potholes further down than the officer can acknowledge, 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5183774</link>
<description>Hello I have just had a chat with the officer marking the potholes in our lane , a very nice chap by the way, and he told me to contact yourselves because he is only allowed to mark the ones from the top of the lane down to Ruddles farm, but we have many many more further down the lane and some very wide and deepso can you please activate this and carry on down to gotherington fields farm and down to springfield hopefully then they could all be sorted. Lots of people are experiencing big problems here with these. Many thanks Alan Vine.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gotherington Fields, Gotherington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5183774&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>There&amp;#39;s a large sign shortly before the 300 yard marker before the J11 exit heading northbound on the M5. I believe it would have once been a brown sign advertising Regency Cheltenham, Gloucester Cathedral &amp;amp; Historic Docks and Forest of Dean, but is now light blue and quite difficult to read. Could this please be replaced - I&amp;#39;m not sure how long it has been like that for but it looks as though it has been a long time.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): M5, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5183372&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in road problem, 7th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5183100</link>
<description>email rcvd 06.11.23 - Good Morning &amp;#10;I would like to claim for a blow out that I had due to the poor condition of one of Tewkesbury B.C roads. On Friday the 6th of October I hit a massive pothole on the Gotherington Fields Road just off the A435, the pothole was just near the Ruddles farm stables, although the whole of that stretch of road is riddled with massive potholes and in terrible condition on the edges. This made me late for work as I had to do the spare and cost me Â£73.24. So, I would like to claim for the tyre and loss of earnings for that morning. If you need anything else, please let me know. All pictures attached , please see the damage the pothole done, it needs addressing asap as that stretch of the road is dreadful. &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5183100&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
