<title>Large bag of rubbish by bench after parish council litter pick, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3307826</link>
<description>I organised a parish council litter pick. We have put all other bags into the large waste bin at swindon village hall. This needs emptying. There is 1 remaining bag at the memorial bench on manor road green area, with rubbish removed from the watercourse that I was not able to put in the village Hall bin. Please arrange for this to be collected by Ubico.. In addition, there is fly tipping behind the electricity substation on the other side of manor road and also at the entrance to dog bark lane. Please have the same team remove this. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Manor Road, Swindon Village&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3307826&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Discarded Dog Poo Bags by Dog Walkers, 10th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3303624</link>
<description>The location is Ham Lane Charlton Kings. The area is now walked by a relatively high number of Dog Walkers. It seems that while they are picking up their dogss poo - they are then throwing the bags in the hedges and on the verges. The location of this particualr pile is on the right hand side going down Ham Lane and opposite the Telephone pool that is on the edge of the car park area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can this mess be cleared up. Other examples have already been picked up by residents.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/3303624.0.jpeg?6d2a2b3f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Cornerstone Ham Lane, Charlton Kings&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3303624&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Huge white caravan parked on road for weeks with no MOT, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3293944</link>
<description>HX05 URF is the number plate of the white motor home. It is against the covernance of the houses and local splay. This is opposite 64 Guan Road. In addition there is a work van parked at 10 Natilus Close which is also against the covernance and reduces the visual splay of the area. Due to the addition of work vans at this property the other people who frequent this property park on the grass which is turning muddy and looks awful.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 61 Guan Road, Brockworth&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3293944&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
