<title>Unclear road markings and signs, 14th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2545156</link>
<description>As you approach from Bishops Cleeve towards the racecourse roundabout along the Evesham Road (Racecourse on your left). There needs to be more road signs and road markings as it is unclear of what lane goes where. The left lane is marked as Left turn only which tells me that is taking you into the racecourse. The right lane is marked right and straight on which tells me this is for all other traffic as well as New Barn Lane (B4075). But 99% of the traffic use the left hand lane even though it is marked left only (Racecourse)to go down New Barn Lane which then blocks the traffic in the right(correct) lane. The left lane needs to be marked for racecourse only or more signs on approach plus better road paint to tell you what lane is for where. At present I am surprised there hasn&amp;#39;t been more accidents due to the difficult to understand signs and markings. Please can this be sorted asap.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Evesham Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2545156&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly Tip, 13th February</title>

<title>Rubbish Bags left after recent Bin Emptying, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2543840</link>
<description>The location is the Cleeve Commons Pylons Car park.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The bins were emptied as normal - some other bags left beside the bins were collected as well. However, a bag behind one of the bins was left and now the local wildlife have torn out the bottom with the danger the rubbish will be blown onto the common if the wind direction changes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can this be cleared up as soon as possible.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/2543840.0.jpeg?356601dc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Mod Communication Site Cleeve Common, Whittington&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2543840&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The location is the Pylons Car Park at the end of the Cleeve Common Road. The material has been dumped just behind the gate at the side of the pylons site.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can it be removed as this is an important part of the AONB&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/2543835.0.jpeg?f23cb75e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Mod Communication Site Cleeve Common, Whittington&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2543835&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unclear road markings, 12th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2543072</link>
<description>Approaching the racecourse roundabout along Evesham Rd with the racecourse on the left additional road markings/lane signage is needed. The left lane is marked as left turn only which suggests it is only for use taking the racecourse exit. The right lane is marked as ahead &amp;amp; right which suggests it’s for traffic taking all other exits including new barn lane. The majority of traffic taking the new barn lane exit uses the left lane meaning the block the traffic in the correct right hand lane. Left lane needs to be marked racecourse only or an additional sign on approach to the roundabout is needed confirming which lane is for which exits. The current ambiguous road markings/lack of lane signage are highly likely to cause a serious accident if they’re not clarified.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Evesham Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2543072&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Chasm of a pothole,(one of many) Robert Burns Avenue, 8th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2533895</link>
<description>A &amp;quot;chasm&amp;quot; of a pothole that is an accident risk to cyclists and motorcyclists and a damage risk to cars is getting bigger by the day. This is adjacent to the speed hump between Colesbourne Road and the entrance to St Mark&amp;#39;s Junior School. This is just one of many that are opening up yet again along the whole length of Robert Burns Avenue. There are better road surfaces in many third world countries caused purely by a lack of maintenance and sub-standard previous repairs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 65 Robert Burns Avenue, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2533895&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
