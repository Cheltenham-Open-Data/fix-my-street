<title>Pipe under road blocked - water building back and overflowing ditch Re:- 11453928, 29th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5781445</link>
<description>Ref:- 11453928 - Highways Job number reported on 28th March 2024. Attempts ahve been made to get an update but nothing at all from Highways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Water - possibly contaminated is flowing down from Ham Hill and via a normally dry ditch. However, due to work up Ham Hill, a lot of silt and hedge cuttings have been washed down. A narrow pipe at the end of an underground culvert became fully blocked and water overflowed and running down the lane. One house has been flooded before on a previous event and luckily not a lot of water entered the property. Please can this be cleared as quickl;y as possible as subsequent rain has increased the flow of water. An update from Highways would be appreciated!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5781445.0.jpeg?9d17e57d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ham Lane, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5781445&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
