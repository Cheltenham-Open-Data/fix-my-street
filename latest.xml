<title>2 drains blocked, 11th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2600404</link>
<description>Both drains at the top of the road leading to the bridge on innsworth Lane (technology park/innsworth side) blocked and have been for several months. The other drains are also in need of cleaning due to large amount of silt in them. There is also a manhole cover on the pavement near the top which also overflows during heavy rain which probably needs investigating.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/2600404.0.jpeg?430e99af&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Innsworth Lane, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2600404&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unlevel road, 10th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2600351</link>
<description>Road un-finished after New estate was built in coopers edge. Road has been finished for quite some time. I&amp;#39;ve lived here over a year and the road still isn&amp;#39;t finished and leveled off. Not great for car tyres. Problem is nearer the roundabout on Buccaneer avenue and past Hitcote Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 3 Buccaneer Avenue, Brockworth&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2600351&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Two very large potholes near the juction of Princess Elizabeth Way and Marsland road., 10th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2600228</link>
<description>There are two large potholes in Marsland road, near the junction with Princess Elizabeth way (GL510GY), one is approximately 18 inches across and the other 16 and are 2 to 3 inches deep that I couldn&amp;#39;t avoid as I drove into Marsland road today and there was a massive bang at the front and rear of my car as I drove into the holes. My car is a Honda Jazz with standard factory fitted suspension, wheels and the tyres have the correct pressures. I was driving no more than 10 miles per hour. It looks like the holes have been marked previously, so either they haven&amp;#39;t been repaired previously or need repairing again.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/2600228.0.jpeg?744bfbf0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Marsland Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2600228&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous dip centre of main road opp. layby entry., 8th March</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2595678</link>
<description>This undulation can cause suspension lurch even at lower speeds on a car travelling close to the centre white, broken line, &amp;amp; I would think at higher speeds it could be classed as dangerous. I ran over this dip when a car moving into the lay-by on the left suddenly braked as it was entering. I was forced to drive close to the broken centre line toward Winchcombe on the B4632.(Road fault is located 1.7 miles from the Rising Sun Hotel)&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Part Parcel 0068 B4632, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2595678&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
