<title>Cold Pool Lane - consider no right turn, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6462493</link>
<description>Each morning, Cold Pool Lane is full of queuing cars due to the railway bridge closure. As the railway bridge is going to be months before repair and the road is open, please consider traffic exiting cold Pool Lane as left turn only and block off right turn. The traffic build up in the lane is purely down to cars who want to turn right but are unable too due to amount of traffic on main road. Making it left turn only would make the lane free flowing and anyone wanting to turn right can go upto the roundabout and back on themselves.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cold Pool Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6462493&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Large dip in pavement and tree root blocking drainage from outside no.10 Leckhampton Road.

<title>Collapsed manhole, cordoned off since 2023, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6460798</link>
<description>On a road traffic island on the junction of Royal Well Road and Royal Well Place, there is a collapsed manhole cover which has been recognised as precarious and potentially hazardous because it has been cordoned off by barriers since last year. But nothing has been done about the hole and because the barriers are precariously positioned on the edge of the island, I have regularly found them collapsed and/or on the busy road itself. When the latter happens, the barriers are more dangerous than the hole they are supposedly protecting. On Monday, I found the manhole cover unprotected, the barriers on the opposite pavement and virtually all of the sandbags designed to keep the barriers in place have now split and therr is sand every where. I have taken numerous pictures but can&amp;#39;t upload them all here. I have reassembled the barriers for approximately the 4th time over the past year.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6460798.0.jpeg?140ce682&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Royal Well Road, Montpellier, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6460798&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Vision difficulties leaving homes 71 - 77 Moorend Rd, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6460611</link>
<description>The above 4 houses are set back from Moorend Rd and exiting from here on to Moorend Rd is extremely dangerous. Even when great care is taken by very slowly edging out it is impossible to be fully aware of approaching cyclists and fast drivers passing. We are dependent on other drivers to be aware of us. A mirror or some means of observing oncoming traffic would be very helpful or a method of slowing down or making other drivers aware of our exit.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 26, Moorend Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6460611&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6460620</link>
<description>&amp;gt; I live in the main house at Ellingham House, 79 Pittville Lawn, GL52 2BP. There is a large tree on the street outside the drive and the problem is that the branches are overhanging the property to a large degree, by many metres. As well as bird fouling, of more concern is the sometimes sizeable chunks of foliage that come down particularly in bad weather. These are large enough to have potential to damage cars, and, more worryingly, my children or other passers-by. I have even stopped parking my car in that part of my drive because of this worry.&amp;#10;&amp;gt;&amp;#10;&amp;gt; I have attached three photos below, one from the front of the property, one from the side to show the overhang of the lower branches, and one from on the property (coincidentally at a time when you could see recently shed foliage from the tree in the photo, though this is relatively small compared to some that have come down).&amp;#10;&amp;gt;&amp;#10;&amp;gt; I would be grateful if someone could arrange to cut the overhang of the upper and lower branches right back so that they are clear of my property boundary.&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6460620&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Faulty pedestrian sensor causing A40 Westbound Red Lights for no reason, 10th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6459426</link>
<description>Presumably a faulty pedestrian crossing sensor is causing the A40 Westbound slip road into Benhall to turn red at every sequence&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is happening all day, every day even when there are no pedestrians or cyclists anywhere near&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The completely unnecessary red lights are delaying buses using the bus lane and traffic turning into Benhall, increasing noise and pollution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The filter lane should only ever turn red when the pedestrian crossing has been activated. Instead it turns red on schedule with each sequence of the main carriageway lights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This has been occurring since the A40 bodged cycleway work was conducted by Bodgeit, Bashit and Scarper Construction over a year ago.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6459426&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
