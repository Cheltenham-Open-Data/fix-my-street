<title>Large pothole, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5555615</link>
<description>Pothole has been patched several times but keeps coming back. Always floods when it rains, and large traffic causes homes to shake. Holes are large enough to cause damage to vehicle suspension and causes cars to swerve.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5555615.0.jpeg?6dbc7c93&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 78, Whaddon Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5555615&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bus stop flooding. Danger to users who have to stand on road., 9th February</title>

<description>Located at junction to cowley village on A435. Drain built last year but hasnâ€™t been cleared. Bus users canâ€™t access the shelter; have to stand on road - no lighting so exceptionally dangerous in the dark- causing danger to life. Have to stand in water for bus to pull off road and get soaked. Has been an issue all winter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5553686.0.jpeg?afb22e97&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road, Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5553686&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Obstruction caused by wall/building problem, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5553672</link>
<description>There is a footpath which has been inaccessible for a number of years. We have brought this to the attention of Tewkesbury Borough council and Glos Footpaths in the past but had no luck in getting this reopened. It is the footpath which links Staverton village to Bamfurlong, near Staverton Airport.&amp;#10;The old entrance to the path on the Gloucester Road B4063, is approximately where I have dropped the pin on the attached Google map. The property where the footpath has been closed off is Oaklands, owned by a Mr Gorman. There have been a number of planning issues with this property over the years and there are enforcements in place here, as well as a number of undetermined planning applications.&amp;#10;I am not expecting an immediate resolution to this, but wondered what Glos Footpaths position is on this and if there is any action being considered.&amp;#10;Yours hopefully.&amp;#10;Bob Lewis &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5553672&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
