<title>Repaired potholes need quality checks, 19th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5464684</link>
<description>These 2 potholes in Mendip Close, 1 outside No7, the other outside No 14 were &amp;#39;repaired&amp;#39; this week late in the evening by 2 operatives with headtorches!. The holes can only be described as &amp;#39;temporary fixes&amp;#39;, in that the tarmac used was obviously left over from a previous job, has not been compacted correctly, and is now being damaged by normal residential traffic. The repairs will not last long in this weather as water will ingress then freeze, and I fully expect to have to report them again very soon. Please inspect and appoint the contractors to re-do the job properly.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5464684.0.jpeg?f77758f2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 7, Mendip Close, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5464684&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pathway is in extremely bad condition, 19th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5464663</link>
<description>The pathway is extremely uneven and shocking condition and the kerbstones are always loose, the kerbstones get fixed every year when they get reported and to be honest i could do a better job with no experience, they last about 5 minutes. Everybody walks on the road because the paths are so uneven and dangerous all the way down to the garages. There are a lot of elderly people down this road as well and they cannot walk on the paths so they walk in the road. I have lived down this road for 20 years and it has never been resolved &amp;#39;properly&amp;#39;. I now live down the bottom by the garages (to the right, and this is in the worse condition) and the road surface is also deteriorating because of all the cars coming down and turning in the same area (in front of my house), so this tarmac could also be fixed in certain areas.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Horsbere Road, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5464663&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Light sensor is not detecting vehicles problem, 19th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5464611</link>
<description>Customer reported that traffic light pole on RHS filter lane if you were driving on the A40 from Oxford to Cheltenham, has been twisted around by approx 45 degrees. Now, when the green light shows, it appears to be signalling to motorists on A436 coming from Stow. Customer drives this route 2 x a day and knows that the traffic light is facing the wrong way. Very concerned that it will cause an accident by signalling motorists from A436 across A40. Traffic light is located on an island by itself. &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5464611&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
