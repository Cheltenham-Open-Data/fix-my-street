<description>FMS rcvd 30.12.23 - Every time there is wind the tree sheds branches which fall onto our driveway. This poses a risk to our children, people waiting at the bus stop and also to our cars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We would ask that the tree is fully checked and dead branches removed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate a response on this issue as it has been an ongoing concern for safety.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395300&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A board belonging to BOOKS &amp; INK obstructing the pavement, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395004</link>
<description>In the MIDDLE of the pavement outside Books &amp;amp; Ink. 6 North St, Winchcombe. I went in ti ask the female owner if she could please relocate the board. She was very challenging, saying that someone had moved it. Si I said I could wait while she repositioned it to a place which would allow the safe passage of mums with pushchairs, disabled folks in mobility scooters and wheelchair users. She didn&amp;#39;t move saying again that someone had moved it. I told her I myself had just had to walk in the road around it. She just sneered saying it was better than parked cars. I didn&amp;#39;t actually see the relevance of that. She really embarrassed herself but after quite a while she did go and move it slightly. Passive aggressive....&amp;quot;you have a lovely new year too&amp;quot;. I feel that she will put it again on the pavement causing an obstruction....merely because she is that way out.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 13a, North Street, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395004&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Path/Way doesn&#39;t match map problem, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5393975</link>
<description>I manage Crickley Hill nature reserve and we are planning some tree felling work to improve the habitat for adders (among others). There is an old pedestrian gate on the south side of Cold Slad Lane (near Clair-de-Lune House, GL3 4UQ) marked by a question mark on the screenshot below. The gate hasnâ€™t been used for a long time, and doesnâ€™t go anywhere, just into impassable scrub and trees. It isnâ€™t marked on the online GCC PRoW map (where the screenshot is from), but Iâ€™m aware the online map isnâ€™t definitive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;I was wondering if you could confirm whether or not there is a public right of way at this location?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5393975&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
