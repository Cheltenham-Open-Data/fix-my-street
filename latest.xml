<title>Stay Left Bollard no longer bolted down, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4103813</link>
<description>The Stay Left Bollard protecting the crossing outside the Smith and Mann shop on Lyefield Road East with a blue arrow was knocked over approximately a year ago. It is the type where the bolts are designed to break on impact, it may be possible to replace the bolts without replacing the entire bollard and base. The brand name on it is &amp;quot;Visaboll&amp;quot; as in the photos. It is a thin and lightweight bollard and without the bolts when the wind blows it falls over.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4103813.0.png?12808e51&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 66 Copt Elm Road, Charlton Kings&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4103813&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Wrong road marking!!!! needs to be solid line, 8th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4100509</link>
<description>On this section of the road after the Kilkeney In as you go towards Gloucester the road markings are wrong, it should not be interrupted line but a continuous solid line as there is no visibility and it is dangerous to overtake. Once I was driving relaxed towards Gloucester in the evening and suddenly when I reached this curve someone from opposite direction engaged in overtaking and appeared straight in front of me. Luckily he managed to get partly back into his lane and I managed to go over the roadside grass and we avoided front head on collision. So the other party relied that the road markings interrupted line are accurate and safe and he used them as guidance, but he did not realise because there is no visibility on this section the road the markings are wrong and needs updating URGENTLY to solid line PLEASE. Thank you!!! The purpose of the road markings and the road signs are to ensure the traffic and the road users are safe if they respect them, but needs to be accurate and realistic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): A436, Andoversford&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4100509&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
