<title>Recently resurfaced patch appears to be breaking down, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6563686</link>
<description>Recently resurfaced patch appears to be breaking down, starting to create a pothole. It&amp;#39;s under the pedestrian bridge, left lane, eastbound, towards the C&amp;amp;G roundabout. I see a note says the area may be due for resurfacing, but could it be surveyed please, and if not due for re-surfacing, be repaired ? So much traffic going through will disintegrate it quickly. Thankyou !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Corinium Avenue, Barnwood, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6563686&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>PROW ASM15 is obstructed by a high palisade steel gate, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6563638</link>
<description>The erection of these gates obstructing ASM15 was first reported in November 2020. It is now nearly four years since PROW were informed and it really is about time something was done! I am reporting again because I see the obstruction is not even registered as an outstanding issue on the County Council map.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): New Road, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6563638&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement from Coombe Hill to The Leigh, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6563292</link>
<description>The path from Coombe Hill to The Leigh is unusable in places due to poor surface, uneven tarmac, holes in the path. Overgrown vegetation on both sides of path and verge. Path from Pancake Lane/Corner to the village has disappeared completely due to years of neglect. This has been ongoing for years and nothing has been done. Vegetation forces you onto the road in places, doing this in the dusk/dark is dangerous.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, Leigh, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6563292&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement needing repair, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6562846</link>
<description>All across the frontage of 169 Hewlett Road the pavement is uneven and damaged. It looks like a utility company has badly backfilled an hole and it’s dropped. Also there are 3 incorrectly placed raised kerb stones which need to be lowered. One section has already been reported and marked however the whole of this section is dangerous to the public. It also is permanently water logged during Winter. Any help is appreciated.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6562846.0.jpeg?7c27a8f0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 169, Hewlett Road, Whaddon, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6562846&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drain is blocked by tree roots, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6562717</link>
<description>The drain outside 349 Hatherley Road is blocked by cedar tree roots. The cedar tree which was owned by Gloucestershire Highways has now been removed but the drain is not flowing properly. My insurance company has commissioned a drainage report which says that part of drain that is full of roots is the councils responsibility to clear and repair. Unfortunately the blockage is causing problems with sewage backing up in the pipes and is causing offensive smells and the toilet to back up. We have tried rodding the roots numerous times but this has not been effective. The drains on my property are damaged and need repair and therefore I understand that drains on council land are also likely to need to be cleared and repaired.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 349, Hatherley Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6562717&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
