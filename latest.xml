<title>Water pools at pedestrian crossing because drain is not at low ground, 5th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6933778</link>
<description>New pedestrian crossing floods due to there not being a drain at low ground. The issue is that the drains are on high ground and therefore jetting them cannot (and has not) rectified this problem. The deep and wide pooling is present after any substantial rainfall, which has been quite frequent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whether as a result of a design problem or a construction problem, it is completely obvious that the issue is the failure to have a drain at low ground where the water pools. The effect of this mistake is water pools where pedestrians are meant to stand and then cross. The result is that pedestrians stand at the cycle crossing. Hundreds of small children cross here every school day. There will be an accident if this is not fixed. This a real risk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have reported this exact issue repeatedly. It needs to be fixed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6933778.0.jpeg?8132277d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 92, Evesham Road, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6933778&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>This is an ongoing issue and I was informed that it was resolved back in November, it is impossible for small children to walk through as it is too deep and as you can see the verges are now covered with the water and very slippery. Elderly people are unable to walk through as the potholes under the water are now very dangerous as you cannot see them. Some vehicles cannot drive through for the same reason., 5th January</title>
