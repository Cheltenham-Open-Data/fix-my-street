<description>All the new lights went on the first night however the setting in of the final overall control box post, facing number 21, has resulted in that lamppost working and others not.

<title>The sign is illegible problem, 30th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5510005</link>
<description>Customer reported ongoing issues with long vehicles/ smaller lorries turning onto Chandos Street from North Street. Roads are too narrow for lorries and long vehicles. They continually get stuck, graze against side of house and break windowsills. There was a bollard to the side of the house but it was situated in a place where it was invisible to drivers until they had already made the turning. Please can something be done about this, it&amp;#39;s causing damage to cars and houses. Signage is inadequate as it doesn&amp;#39;t say &amp;#39;no long vehicles&amp;#39;. Also very unsafe for foot traffic. &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5510005&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overgrown debris and soil renders the pavement very narrow and dangerous as fast traffic is only a foot away from pedestrians. Impassable for pushchairs. Totally unsafe for children to use., 30th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5509179</link>
<description>The stretch of pavement between Gotherington Garage and the lay-by outside Bishops Cleeve is particularly narrow. The next stretch to Nortenham allotments is poor. Then there is no pavement along the A435 for 200m or so. The pavement is unusable because it means pedestrians have to walk in single file very very close to the kerb.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A435, Gotherington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5509179&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
