<title>Loose/rattling cover/ironwork problem, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539226</link>
<description>passed through Montpellier Gardens recently and the grate is fully blocked up with moss – it’s deeply entrenched and can’t be removed easily at all. I tried digging away at it a bit out of curiosity with my hands, but it really couldn’t be budged&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539226&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Loose/rattling cover/ironwork problem, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539225</link>
<description>-&amp;#9;Marsh Lane quickly fills with surface water, filling from the Hardwick Green side. On Friday it reached about halfway across the road, but normally rainwater streams in from Swindon Road with the corner of Cleveland Street becoming submerged. This is a regular occurrence whenever there is a downpour, no matter how brief it is. There may be something blocking the grates like moss or green growth. Please would you be able to take a look into it?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539225&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Loose/rattling cover/ironwork problem, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539084</link>
<description>Residents measured the rate of rainfall and found on Friday they were 10 centimetres from their property flooding. They were incredibly anxious and couldn’t sleep from the panic of it, and flooding is often recurrent along the length of Townsend Street and at their section of Swindon Road. The drains on the roadway are often blocked with overgrowth rather than leaves since there are no trees on their street. Please could you look into their situation as a matter of urgency and feed back to me how things go? Thank you so much!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539084&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Croft Lane - Concerns Regarding Path Condition and Overhanging Trees, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539035</link>
<description>Unfortunately, the path along Croft Lane is in very poor condition, which makes it extremely difficult for disabled people to navigate safely. In addition to this, several trees along the lane have overhanging branches, some of which have begun to fall, posing a serious safety risk to anyone using the path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given these issues, I kindly request that the necessary actions be taken to repair the path and trim the trees before an accident occurs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your attention to this matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Croft Lane, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6539035&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple potholes and road edge deterioration, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6538689</link>
<description>There are multiple potholes and road edge deterioration along the stretch of road known as Birdlip Hill from the turn off at Cirencester Road (including a bit of Ermine way) all the way uphill to the junction at Birdlip.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A number of previously repaired potholes have opened up again and if facing uphill, on the right hand side of the road in many places the road edge has been scoured away by water and is breaking up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is hard to pin point an exact location as there are a number of defects, causing traffic on both sides to cross the mid line. In the fog and mist we had today this is especially dangerous.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ermin Way, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6538689&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Roots of oak tree causing problems for 8 Barrington Avenue, The Reddings, Cheltenham GL51 6TY, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6537403</link>
<description>The oak tree is located on public land to the side of 6 Barrington Avenue, The Reddings, Cheltenham, and approximately 8 metres from 8 Barrington Avenue. Our driveway appears to have root incursion as the tarmac by the side of our front entrance and other places has lifted, and recurred after mending. This has been a growing problem for a couple of years. The footpath beside the oak tree is also showing some early signs of root disturbance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 6, Barrington Avenue, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6537403&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
