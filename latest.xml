<description>There are numerous reports of potholes further along the road but the issue stretches the entire road. It’s been the case for months and months and with every spell of cold weather it breaks down more. It shakes my entire car - I’m considering exchanging it for a dune buggy with these roads!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 127, Caernarvon Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5502907&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Subsiding / broken tarmac next to a drain, 28th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5502564</link>
<description>Between Tesco and Pirton Lane traffic lights, southwest bound, a low drain (which I think may have been repaired in the last few months) has surrounding tarmac subsiding, and is creating a hard lip edge on the side facing traffic. Could it be checked and ideally repaired please ?

<title>NUMEROUS DEEP POTHOLES FROM SEVEN SPRINGS ROUNDABOUT TO COTSWAY BARN. there is no response to the emergency line so to inform you I&#39;ve reduced the size. there are in excess of 20., 28th January</title>

<description>You filled in 30 + potholes between seven springs roundabout and Cotsway barn previously. 20 have re-emerged. Some are dangerously deep but there is no response to your emergency number. This has already cost me 2 tyres and 2 shock absorbers. They need repairing, preferably the road resurfacing as the repairs don&amp;#39;t last more than 4 months.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hartley Lane, Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5501281&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cars parking right up to blind spot round from Birdlip to Brimpsfield, 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499994</link>
<description>Going through Birdlip round to the bend towards Brimpsfield cars are parking right up to the corner. Lines are faded and going that way has potential to drive into car coming round the bend from Brimpsfield. It is more concerning due to the amount of traffic coming from Brimpsfield and number of larger vehicles. There is just no where to go and coming from Birdlip you have to commit to going through as no gaps to pull in. To be fair it has only been recently cars have parked there but every day the last few week ps in rush hour it has been a concern. I notice a similar issue around this area was reported but stating it’s closed so wanted to highlight it as it is such a blind bend and people drive fast around that corner. Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ermin Way, Birdlip, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499994&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>My 89 year old father fell due to this pot hole. He was walking slowly and was very lucky not to be seriously hurt. It could have resulted in hospitalisation. He was dizzy afterwards as he has a weak heart. It is dangerous for any elderly people. My mum has had a hip replacement and has sight loss. They live locally and walk this route several times a week., 27th January</title>

<title>Dangerous parking, 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499889</link>
<description>Car owners park their cars on the south side of Westfield Avenue despite having driveways that they could park on. This has the effect of forcing drivers on to the wrong side of the road as they are approaching the blind corner on this junction. People driving in the opposite direction, from Ermin Park onto Westfield Ave tend to take this corner at speed, only to be confronted with oncoming traffic on their side of the road. This has been an issue for 5+ years. Serious accident as a result in 2018 but no action taken. Double yellow lines needed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5499889.0.jpeg?343f38fb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westfield Avenue, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499889&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
