<title>Very narrow pavement, 29th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5266302</link>
<description>A section of pavement at the bus stop on London Rd close to Grevill House is too narrow for wheel chair users to reach the bus stop safely. As a result a wheel chair user recently almost lost wheels over the curb and came close to be tipped over into the road. It could be due to the bank adjoining the pavement encroaching onto the pavement over time, or not enough of the bank was removed when the pavement was constructed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5266302.0.jpeg?ff8650aa&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 279, London Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5266302&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A pothole in pavement problem, 29th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5265982</link>
<description>Good morning&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would like to report a pothole.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is located outside the entrance to St Edwards, the Sixways site, and the same entrance which serves for the carpark/ Sixways medical practice. &amp;#10;The hole is located on the pavement and is about 2 feet  in diameter and 10cm deep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IT seems to have been highlighted for repair some time ago but never actually filled in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are many elderly people who use the pavement regularly and are at risk because of the position and extent of the defect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5265982&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The road closure dates on the entrance to North Street are incorrect, 29th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5264428</link>
<description>The road closure dates on the entrance to North Street are incorrect. They state that the road will be closed between 4th - 8th December 2023, when in fact it should read 4th-7th December. This is very important because the town&amp;#39;s Xmas Fair is to be held on 8th December and the road needs to be available for stallholders and pedestrians alike. Please can this be amended as a matter of urgency, giving out the correct message.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 14, North Street, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5264428&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>One of the unilluminted bollards has bene knocked over. I have moved the sign to a nearby tree as it was lying on the pavement. I am not sure it has been hit by a car, i think it has just been pushed over. The retaining bolts are into tarmac only and are only a few inches long. The tarmac has cracked and sign is totally detached., 29th November</title>
