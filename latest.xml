<title>Deep gouge in road on both sides of the carrigeway, 17th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5456162</link>
<description>On the M5 exit south where the slip road meets the a40 and on the opposite side just before the A40 meets the slip road from benhall Cheltenham there is deep gouges in the road which is dangerous for motorcycles. The gouges cause any two wheeled vehicle a real danger as the wheel once inthe crack cause the front wheel to track the direction of the crack and could cause a loss of control of the vehicle. This has happened due to the poor repaiur work recently and as such I have contacted the local newspaper as this could easily cause a fatality. I would suggest you give this matter some importance before you have the death of someone on your hands .&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A40, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5456162&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>One light out In the road that runs alongside churchdown club from church road, up to the car park, and I think two not working in the car park itself.

<title>No White Lines, 17th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5455489</link>
<description>Please could I ask that white lines be painted down the middle of the road, from the Down Hatherley Traffic lights, right up to and adjoining the lines at Innsworth Traffic lights (a section of road has no white lines whatsoever, only SLOW painted on in both directions. When the sun is shining, around 3pm (or low sunshine) car drivers are being blinded, and now with the very narrow lane, due to the cycle lane works, we can&amp;#39;t see the verge at all and with hardly any room to play with, especially with a bus coming towards you, or a lorry, in the opposite direction, I&amp;#39;m afraid an accident will occur.

<title>Double yellow lines required, 17th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5453972</link>
<description>I would like to highlight, that double yellow lines are urgently required on the junction between Windyridge Rd and Roman Hackle Avenue due to the significant hump in the road and large vehicles (for example working vans but also personal vehicles) being constantly parked directly opposite the junction. This limits the visibility and pushes the vehicles coming up the hill in the middle of the road. I&amp;#39;ve been living in Limber Hill for 3 years now and I can&amp;#39;t even list how many times I had a dangerous situation trying to turn right from Windyridge Road. I really hope this could be considered to ensure the resident&amp;#39;s safety. Further to that, if double yellow lines could be extended 10-15m into the junction of Roman Hackle Avenue this would help Limber Hill&amp;#39;s residents immersively to safely join the traffic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Roman Hackle Avenue, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5453972&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
