<title>Major pothole towards middle of the road that almost threw me of my bike when travelling at speed, 17th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242383</link>
<description>Pothole is near the middle of the road but on the left hand side when travelling down the hill. Pothole is in the section of the road with trees on both sides and is very difficult for cyclists to see or avoid.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ermin Way, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242383&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pedestrian view obstruction, 17th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242276</link>
<description>The view from crossing from Tommy Taylor’s Lane into Pittville Park is completely obscured by an over grown verge. Pedestrians have to lean into the on coming traffic to see if it’s safe to cross. I have already reported this as a hazard and nothing has been done about it. Many children use this point to cross and it’s a section of the road that vehicles tend to speed up. Please do not ignore this request as it is a danger and needs to be dealt with asap. This has been an issue for 3 months.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6242276.0.jpeg?8b94886d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tommy Taylors Lane, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242276&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>There is a deep pothole on Beaufort Road at junction with Oakhurst Rise, 17th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242179</link>
<description>There is a deep pothole on Beaufort Road at junction with Oakhurst Rise. There are a couple of blobs of white paint close to it but no reports that a pothole in this location is due to be fixed. It appears to have been missed when I recently reported it along with a couple of other potholes requiring repair in this location.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6242179.0.jpeg?39290208&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 3, Beaufort Road, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242179&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Missing stop lines on approach to junction, 17th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242175</link>
<description>The road surface has been re-laid at the northern side of the cross-roads but the stop lines (on the side of the road travelling from Upper Dowdeswell towards the A436) have not been relaid. This means that there is a risk someone might drive across the junction without stopping and cause an accident. I have needed to swerve out of the way to avoid a car that misjudged where to stop at this junction more than once (on both occasions I was travelling from the Kilkenny Pub direction towards Andoversford).&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Andoversford, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242175&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The roadworks were not advertised, 17th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242042</link>
<description>On the roundabout as shown on map. No issue ahead of the works to notify these were happening and no warning ahead of the roadworks they were even their. I missed an urgent GP appointment (suspected cancer) because of these roadworks. Then took me as long to get home. I have a disability so this was an issue. 4 way roadworks on a roundabout for the a46 was poor judgement without notification first (nothing on highways). The work was not even on the road itself a mnd this follows numerous roadworks in the vicinity.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6242042&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Third and final bollard on pavement has been knocked down, 17th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6241494</link>
<description>The third and final bollard outside 50 Hall Road has now been knocked over. The other two bollards which have been knocked over in the same place have not been replaced so people park increasingly dangerously on the blind corner. Please could the bollards be replaced to stop people parking “just for 2 seconds” when they are dropping off their kids as it will inevitably cause an accident eventually. The fact all three bollards have been knocked over in such a short period just shows how dangerously people drive on Hall Road at school rush times. The bollards could very easily have been my children standing on the pavement outside our house.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6241494.0.jpeg?c56a20bd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 54, Hall Road, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6241494&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
