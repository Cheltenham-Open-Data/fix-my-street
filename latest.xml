<description>Drains are becoming more and more blocked with silt and crumbled tarmac left by gasworks over the last few months.

<title>Trench all way down side of kayte lane, causing tyre blowout, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5431728</link>
<description>When travelling south down kayte lane, I hit a pothole which caused my tyre to blow. I had to buy a new tyre as a result of the damage. There is a trench running all the way down the left side of the road with multiple places where a blowout would be possible, I can&amp;#39;t pinpoint exactly where it happened. The road is busy and narrow and I see that someone else had exactly the same issue in November (and I can see where a tiny fix has been made). This needs to be filled all the way down the road as I&amp;#39;m not the first this has happened to and I&amp;#39;m sure I won&amp;#39;t be the last unless this fixed properly, rather than filling in tiny portions of it&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kayte Lane, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5431728&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Over 30 cans thrown in hedgerow, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5430102</link>
<description>I have undertaken regular litter picking in Shaw Green Lane for many years and I have noticed in the last year that someone is regularly drinking alcohol at the quieter end of the road and throwing their cans into the hedgerow. I collected over 30 cans today, and there affre many more that I can&amp;#39;t get to. I was wondering if some signage could go up to try and deter them, such as &amp;#39;we are watching you&amp;#39; or a littering penalty notice.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shaw Green Lane, Prestbury, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5430102&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree is damaged problem, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5428941</link>
<description>email rcvd 09.01.24 - Dear Sir,&amp;#10;A few months ago, you cut down a dead tree which had been growing in the grass verge outside my house.&amp;#10;You left a stump about three feet tall quoting &amp;#39;health and safety&amp;#39;. I understood that you were going to grind it out.&amp;#10;Since I keep stumbling into it in the dark, I hope that you could &amp;#39;grind it out&amp;#39; soon. The question arises about a replacement tree. When and what sort of tree will you put there. We would NOT LIKE a Flowering Cherry out side the house for example. &amp;#10;If we, (wife and I), have an input about a replacement tree, we would like sometyhing MORE substantial and we would LOOK AFTER IT in subsequent years,(watering), etc.&amp;#10;When can we hope for a replacement?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5428941&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
