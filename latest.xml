<description>The end space of the top parking bay, closest to 22, Corpus Street. It&amp;#39;s very inconveniently positioned where a car&amp;#39;s tyres would be when parked.

<title>Blocked off pavement with verge reduced to mud, 10th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197692</link>
<description>Several months ago, possibly July, a barrier was put up presumably because of the instability of the wall of the property (St Ives Court) on the side of the pavement on Albert Road between East Approach Drive and Marston Road. The situation has been getting worse as everyone has to walk, push prams or cycles over the grass verge which is now reduced to soft mud. There appears to be no action underway to remedy the wall, to allow the tarmac pavement to return to use. Either this needs to be undertaken soon (presumably it is quite a dangerous state) or some kind of paving needs to be laid where the grass verge has turned to mud.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5197692.0.jpeg?a1cc5ce0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Albert Road, Marle Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197692&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The stream normally runs underground in the road past West Ridge. The pipe is blocked and water now runs widely across the road past Woodbine and Hillside properties., 10th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197575</link>
<description>In freezing conditions ice would form across the full width of the lane and be a serious hazard. A mass of small stones cause the blockage which is visible through the grating outside West Ridge. The problem arose about ten days ago after heavy rain. Please arrange removal of the blockage.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bushcombe Lane, Woodmancote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197575&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Deteriorating road surface., 10th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197467</link>
<description>Badly deteriorating road surface in the area of Noâ€™ 7 Branch Hill Rise and Noâ€™ 10 Branch Hill Rise. ALL traffic using this road is forced to use one lane of the highway due to the permanent presence of parked cars on one side of the road. Consequently just one side of the highway is carrying all traffic using this road. Please repair this stretch as itâ€™s obviously going to need repairing sooner or later. Many thanks in advance for your help.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 3, Branch Hill Rise, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197467&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Not enough time for cyclists to get through lights, 10th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197287</link>
<description>I can see this has already been posted but I&amp;#39;m adding to the people stating how dangerous it is. Maybe if you&amp;#39;re Mark Cavendish you can make it over the bridge before being faced with vehicles driving straight at you but most of us aren&amp;#39;t professional cyclists. It&amp;#39;s dangerous and I&amp;#39;m fed up of being tooted at and verbally abused by drivers driving straight at you. Every time temporary lights are put up on this railway bridge, not enough time is allowed for cyclists - even peddling as fast I can on my road bike, I can&amp;#39;t get through in time.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Badgeworth Road, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197287&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flooding at junction of Martindale road and Andorra way, 10th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197104</link>
<description>Flooding at junction of Martindale road and Andorra way. This was looked at a few weeks ago and the problem clearly has not been solved. I observe that three grids in total are blocked, the one in the flood, one across the road on the junction with Andorra road and one further east on Martindale road. All drains either side appear to function correctly so it appears that there is a problem connecting all the grids and local to this junction.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5197104.0.jpeg?22ea4d3b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Martindale Road, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5197104&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
