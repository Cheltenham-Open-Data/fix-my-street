<title>On the Hucclecote Road, travelling towards Gloucester, but before the M5 bridge. It is beyond the turning to Bird Road and yes it has painted lines but I am fed up with trying to report this problem. I must inform you that having told you of this problem if I hear or learn of a cyclist being involved in an accident at this point I will report you to the relevant authorities. This is a very dangerous pothole for cyclists of which I am one. Finally this website is so difficult to use and as I type out this message I can only see the last few words which again is indicative of a poorly designed website . If you wish to call me to discuss this my telephone number is (01452) 611614., 10th January</title>

<description>Hucclecote Road going into Gloucester before the M5 bridge. The pothole is beyond the turning to bird Road. I have to say that this process has been very time-consuming and the cynic in me says that this is deliberate to ensure that people do not report these problems. They simply give up because of the time taken.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5425788.0.jpeg?67c2d052&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Road, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5425788&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bad road markings, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5424883</link>
<description>Cars exiting old Gloucester Road wanting to go straight on, cut across traffic turning right and on a number of occasions have nearly come in contact with each other in the centre of the junction. I feel this could easily be remedied by changing the left-hand lane to just left, and the right hand lane to straight on and turn right, so traffic uses one lane for both directions&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5424883.0.jpeg?55563a27&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5424883&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The highway is directly up against the foundations of an exsisting Cotswold Boundry wall of a property Shepherds Cottage. The surface of the highway has been eroded by the constant flow of storm water along the surfaces. A repair is urgently required as it is undermining the foundation of the boundary wall which could cause it to collapse. Highways own the road up to the boundary wall - there is no verge., 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5422872</link>
<description>The erosion is directly outside Shepherd’s Cottage Shipton Oliffe. It runs all the way along the frontage boundary wall on the highway itself.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5422872.0.jpeg?648dc43e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shipton, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5422872&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
