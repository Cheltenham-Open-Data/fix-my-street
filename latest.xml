<title>Light sensor is not detecting vehicles problem, 22nd January</title>

<description>Customer states that when the Ped crossing on Glouecster road is pressed the traffic builds up and traffic gets stuck on the junction with Tewksbury Road. Advised that the ped crossing is independent from the lights at the junction but sig faults may be able to look at the timings coming off the junction and ease the traffic getting stuck on the junction.  &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5477050&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The sign is illegible problem, 22nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5475567</link>
<description>email rec 19/01/2024 - Another thing I would like to mention is that signs about diversions are left up long after the diversion is no longer necessary.  This causes confusion for motorist.  Also signs warning of flood or other hazards are also left in place after the hazard has passed.  There is a flood warning sign near the Double Tree Hotel which has been there for some considerable time.  Is there some department that is tasked to collect such signs? If they were collected in timely fashion it would save the Highways authority money in not having to have more signs manufactured.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5475567&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The sign is illegible problem, 22nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5475565</link>
<description>email rec 19/01/2024 - I’m writing because I have a concern about the sign that has been erected by the Car Park of the Clock Tower Restaurant in Cirencester Road  Charlton Kings.  It is meant to flash to warm motorists that they are exceeding the 30 limit but it isn’t flashing. To help you locate it the Post code for the Clock Tower is  would be GL53 8DY.  There is one on the same side of the road but nearer to the Double Tree Hotel  that is flashing.  Vehicles do come down Charlton Hill too fast and need to be reminded of the speed limit before entering the built up area.  &#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5475565&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
