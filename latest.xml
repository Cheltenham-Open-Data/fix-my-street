<title>Flood of 150meters along gretton rd, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2565898</link>
<description>I have reported it and a council department came and saw it and said it was not them but the highways and would report it 5 weeks ago. This was even more dangerous when it was frozen as cars going through this water was spreading it all over the paths and the road, I saw an elderley lady fall over. This is more like a stream (not a trickle) with a fast flow rate. This happened last year as well but did not resolve the problem.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 9 Gretton Road, Gotherington&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2565898&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No T junction sign for this no through road, 22nd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2564379</link>
<description>At the top of Sandycroft Road main road end there is a 20mph speed limit sign but we need a no through road sign. Many vehicles try coming through the road not realising it’s blocked off, they are trying to cut through to the other side of Sandycroft Road. Many delivery drivers are making this mistake. A no through road or T Junction sign would help avoid this.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Plots 5 And 6 Sandycroft Road, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/2564379&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
