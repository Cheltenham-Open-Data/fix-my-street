<title>Barrier blocking pavement, 22nd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5242578</link>
<description>These barriers have been here for almost 4 months now blocking the pavement for disabled people and families with a push chair getting past. There was a small hole in the p[ath which was filled in when the barriers were put in place and they have been there every since with no sign of any actual work being done to fix any problem that may still exist so they need to be removed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5242578.0.jpeg?13aee750&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cotswold Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5242578&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Recently a poor repair was reported and an attempt made to repair road surface. Defect has been overfilled with the result being that instead of hitting a dip in the road you now hit a hump., 22nd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5242336</link>
<description>There was a poorly repaired trench at the junction, in that there was a ridge around the repair and the repair was below the road surface. Not an enjoyable experience for cyclists. At attempt has been made to repair. It seems to me that the end result is that too much tarmac has been used, there is now a hump with a similar impact for the cyclist.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Belmont Avenue, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5242336&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dropped pavement is too high., 22nd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5241667</link>
<description>The dropped pavement outside 13, Lichfield Drive is too high. I feel it is damaging my car every time I drive over it into my drive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I moved into this property 4 weeks ago, so this issue has been there since I moved in. I don&amp;#39;t know when the pavement was dropped originally.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Is it possible to have this dropped further?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5241667.0.jpeg?73013d12&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 11, Lichfield Drive, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5241667&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>This is a 36cm wide pothole, 7cm deep, 92cm from the kerb into the road., 22nd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5241571</link>
<description>The hole has gradually become larger over several years, starting as a crack in the tarmac. It is located in Albemarle Road in the road between the front of house numbers 25 and 25A. This area of Albemarle Road receives double traffic along the one lane due to parked cars on the other side. Therefore there is a lot of wear on that area of road and over the hole. The hole is likely to get larger as the winter frosts arrive. Myself, and my neighbour at no 25A, both turn onto the hole as we leave our drives.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5241571.0.jpeg?3c6182dd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Albemarle Road, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5241571&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

I know it has been like that for 2 years, as my son repositioned the temporary sign when it was blown over in the wind before Christmas 2021!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;High time that Glos County Council sorted this out permanently, as it is an eyesore in a Conservation area.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5241362&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
