<title>Holes in road from removal of studs/markings, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5436438</link>
<description>On the B4063 between the fire station and entrance to Pirton Fields there are holes in the road from the removal of studs/road markings prior to the cycle lane being installed. These are noticeable holes that ideally require filling at least temporarily. It could be argued that the road needs attention since the works to install the cycle lane has caused a patchwork surface.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5436438&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
