<title>As reported before, pedestrian area flooding, drains are either blocked or damaged, 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5582301</link>
<description>This same issue was reported earlier this year, was investigated and closed - but importantly no action has been taken. There are drains there in a relatively new pedestrianisation scheme outside John Lewis. It needs sorting.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5582301.0.jpeg?53113574&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 128, High Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5582301&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Deepening and wide pothole appearing again on south side of highway., 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5582239</link>
<description>South side of highway where the wide Charlton Lane meets the narrower Greenhills Road making the location even more dangerous. This pothole keeps reappearing and the repair method is clearly not good enough, a more substantial and permanent repair is self evidently required, as I believe other contributors have said.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Greenhills Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5582239&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Sustained damage problem, 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5581077</link>
<description>Good morning,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This morning I noticed a broken bollard outside HSBC on Cheltenham high street. The bollard is lying at the edge of the road and there is about 6 inches left sticking up out of the pavement. Could this please be made safe as soon as possible? Even a cone on top of it would help as a temporary measure so no one trips or breaks their foot on it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Iâ€™ve CCed in Townscape in case it falls under their responsibility.&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5581077&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Man(person?)hole/cover subsidence., 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5580285</link>
<description>The personhole cover (I wouldn&amp;#39;t want the problem ignored because I misgendered it) has been subsiding for a while and seems to be getting worse. The pothole/subsidence is in the road, as can be seen from the pics if they uploaded, outside number 54 Charlton Lane Leckhampton. As far as I recall it connects to a main surface water sewer, but there is also a culverted stream that runs nearby ( 5 to 10 meters towards Pilley Bridge direction), which I thought might possibly be related to the issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5580285.0.jpeg?cb2aa7a0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 54, Charlton Lane, Leckhampton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5580285&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Old Bath Road, northbound on mini-roundabout, immediately by Sandford Road eastbound exit., 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578989</link>
<description>Potholes between the roundabout white disc marking and the Sandford Road &amp;#39;give way&amp;#39; line. As northbound vehicles take the right-hand bend at this point, potholes cause bad jarring which affects roadholding. At most hours of the day it is impossible to swerve around them by driving straight across the humped white disc which is a discomfort in itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Recent work was done to repair potholes in the southbound carriageway just feet away and it&amp;#39;s bizarre that the worst northbound potholes weren&amp;#39;t dealt with at the same time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks in advance&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sandford Road, Tivoli, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578989&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Harp Hill; Multiple potholes, especially between Battledown Families Centre and junction with Camp Road, 15th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578978</link>
<description>Too many individual failures to list separately. They have been present and worsening for years.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vehicles need extra traction to hold the road because of curvature and steep gradient, but handling my car safely up and down Harp Hill (which I use almost every day) has become extremely challenging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During most hours of the day, oncoming traffic prevents swerving to avoid the worst potholes but some motorists still attempt to do this causing me to brake sharply. The few remedial repairs done in recent years haven&amp;#39;t lasted. Traffic is increasing because of new development.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some trenches dug in Harp Hill by utility companies have not been properly made good afterwards and can cause &amp;#39;tramlining&amp;#39;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If these defects are not attended to, or better still the whole road resurfaced as well as you&amp;#39;ve recently done in St. Pauls Road and Pittville Circus, Harp Hill will become unsafe very soon and it needs to be prioritised.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks in advance&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stanley Road, Battledown, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5578978&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
