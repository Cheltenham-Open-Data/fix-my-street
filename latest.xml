<title>3 glass panes missing in pavement skylight (?), 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6724556</link>
<description>Set in the pavement, on the north side of Eldorado Road, is what looks like a skylight- multiple glass panes within metal framework. 3 panes are missing but partially obscured by fallen leaves. Someone in heels or with walking stick or frame could come a cropper.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6724556.0.jpeg?2d8df15e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 19, Eldorado Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6724556&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Previous repair breaking down again., 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6724158</link>
<description>Previous job ref : 6563686 I think this has already been recently highlighted by a member of the public, but this recently repaired patch is breaking down again. Location is under the pedestrian overpass bridge, leading to the C&amp;amp;G roundabout, Glos. I see there are road works scheduled Dec 4-5th, so this might cover it ? Otherwise, can you survey it and repair it again please ? Thankyou !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Corinium Avenue, Barnwood, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6724158&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rush hour traffic increase due to diversion, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6722763</link>
<description>At the cold pool lane junction into Grovefield way &amp;amp; cold pool lane main road continuation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Due to the bridge closure on badgeworth lane, all traffic has been diverted into cold pool lane going into Cheltenham causing a huge congestion for villiagers that live in Badgeworth and beyond. The current wait time from 7.30 ish to just get to the end of cold pool lane from Badgeworth lane is well over 30 minutes due to the fact that they is no priority when joining the Grovefield way - cold pool lane main road. Please can temporary traffic lights be erected at the junction to help ease congestion, giving everyone an equal run of getting to where they need to go whilst the road closure is in place, and make everyone’s life a lot less stressful in the mornings. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cold Pool Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6722763&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>SUGGESTION : To add an arrowed lane control sign ?, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6722377</link>
<description>Hello, would you consider *adding* an arrowed lane control sign on Kayte lane, approaching GE traffic lights, from Southam ? The approach lane splits into two lanes, with the left lane **only going left**, and with the painted lane control arrows fairly close to the lights, and of there&amp;#39;s traffic queueing and obscuring them, it&amp;#39;s very difficult / impossible to determine which lane to be in on approach. As a driving instructor, I&amp;#39;d teach &amp;#39;default left to go ahead&amp;#39;, but in this case it only goes left. Like Gloucester Road (Dean Close School), there are two &amp;#39;left only&amp;#39; signs on approach where the road lanes split. Many thanks !

<title>A pothole in road problem, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6721358</link>
<description>Please see the photo of what appears to be a developing sinkhole on Corndean Lane near Winchcombe.  Other than the telegraph poles, there are few features or landmarks on this section of road, but I believe the defect is in the section of map shown.  Towards the top of the first steep section of road.  It is on the left as one ascends the hill.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6721358&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
