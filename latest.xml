<title>Drain blockage or restriction, 15th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6615387</link>
<description>From the photos it can be seen that a heavy storm of rain on Tuesday 08/10/24 onto already saturated ground allowed a River of water to start at top of field, the field has a substantial slope my front garden received a torrent of muddy water, there is a drain on the road outside my garden gate, but it was unable to cope with this amount of mud and water from the field, it over spilled the drain and flooded the road, opposite my bungalow is another &amp;amp; the volume of water washed all their driveway gravel down to their door went around the. side of house and filled their fish pond with muddy water, killing the fish, there is a further road drain by the gate of bungalow 3 this also could not cope with the mud and water volume, it is perhaps drain blockage or restriction but the danger is this could happen all over again, some investigation would seem to be required.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6615387.0.jpeg?c38ef41a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Colesbourne, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6615387&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree overhanging footpath. Adults have to bend awkwardly to get under it and for those of us with back/spinal problems, it is a risky move. I am really worried it could damage my back further. I walk to improve my mobility and so I want to keep walking up this beautiful footpath which is parallel to the main road. The overhanging tree is near the top of the footpath which ends opposite Daisy Bank Road., 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6614648</link>
<description>Near the top of the footpath which runs parallel to Leckhampton Hill Road. The lower part of the footpath starts at Leckhampton Views (off Leckhampton Road) which is a newish housing estate and the footpath ends opposite Daisybank Road - this is the top part and the overhanging tree is very near the top end. I think the storms caused the tree to bend severely. The footpath used to be clear to walk along.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Leckhampton Hill, Shurdington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6614648&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rattling drain, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6614100</link>
<description>I had automated email confirmation that report number 6576176 had been repaired. However, the drain cover is rattling and just as loud as it was before. My neighbours and I can&amp;#39;t sleep at night or think straight during the day! I can see that they&amp;#39;ve put some tarmac in the gap around the drain cover but they haven&amp;#39;t secured the drain cover down.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cirencester Road, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6614100&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
