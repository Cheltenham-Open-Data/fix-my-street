<title>Drains at bottom of Malvern Walk blocked, 26th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7035766</link>
<description>Every time there is any sustained rainfall, big pools of water build up by the gate at the end of Malvern Walk. There are drains on either side, but neither is effective, presumably due to significant blockage. Leaves and other debris on the road surface were cleared recently, but this hasn’t reduced the water build up. This also leads to water running down the lowest part of Malvern Walk and creating a flood on the Honeybourne Line at the corner with Malvern Walk.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7035766.0.jpeg?5f5fb6e1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Honeybourne, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7035766&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drain is blocked so flooding on road at area GL54 5TH, 26th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7035478</link>
<description>The multi outlet drain is blocked and flooding outside Whitton Dean and Hyak in Brockhampton GL54 5TH. The highway men tried to clear it 24th January but you can see from the attached photos taken on 26th January that the problem is still here. The highway men said to us that the multi drain outside Whitton Dean and the drain opposite both need high pressure jetting. The road is flooding and can turn to ice which is very dangerous. Please could you clear both the drains with jets as soon as possible.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7035478.0.jpeg?ef8aef34&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Charlton Abbots Road, Sudeley, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7035478&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drainage insufficent outside my house, 26th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7035432</link>
<description>The drain at the end of All Saints Road is not working as it should. There is usually a large puddle that drivers splash through and this trails back to puddles along the street on the &amp;quot;odd number&amp;quot; side. A puddle outside my house (number 9) regularly gets driven through, splashing my house and causing damage to the front door and render. This is true for puddles further along the street and other properties. A street sweeper recently cleared put some soil and dirt build-ups, but this hasn&amp;#39;t helped the water to drain. The road needs to be resurfaced so that water travels properly to the drains.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7035432.0.jpeg?a10313d3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 64, Hewlett Road, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7035432&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drain Blocked as PREVIOUSLY Reported, 26th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7034747</link>
<description>The drain at the bend on Ham Lane is BLOCKED causing water that comes down from the CLEAR ditch above it / feeding it to exit the drain vis the cover instead of ging down the undergraound culvert.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This twas previously reported and at the time of inspection only a small amount of water was going into the drain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is important please that this is cleared - blockage could be due to a brick having dropped out of the old brick built culvert roof. If the rain gets any heavier then there is a danger surface water from the blocked drain could go into one of the properties.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7034747.0.jpeg?d7f33fcb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 3, Ham Lane, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7034747&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The cross road drain from the GCC manhole to the ditch on the opposite side of the road is either blocked or has collapsed, 26th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7034663</link>
<description>As the Registered Flood warden for the Village I have reported this problem on several occasions but to no avail. Dur to seriously heavy traffic accessing the new Electricity Substation on Bozards lane I believe the cross road train has collapsed under the weight of oversized vehicles. when there is a storm, the water now flows over the road and is a danger. This is part of the GCC Highways storm water drainage for the main road through Tredington known as Stoke Road from The Odessa Junction on the A38 and Bishops Cleeve. Having been in this condition during several flood incidents in 2024 urgent action is required.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stoke Orchard, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7034663&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
