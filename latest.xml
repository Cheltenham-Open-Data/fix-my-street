<title>Drains are blocking on a regular basis with excessive water running across the road from junction of Cirencester road and road up to Birdlip (12 bells pub junction) both from the overflowing ditches from farmland and surface water running off from the side of telephone exchange. This is causing regular flooding to the road and our driveway despite me regularly clearing drains during heavy downpours., 10th February</title>

<description>The lights on this pedestrian crossing are constantly changing without any control.

<title>Deep Pothole - Caernarvon Road, 10th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5558442</link>
<description>This is where your nearside wheels are, as you approach the mini roundabout in a north westerly direction. It&amp;#39;s over 3&amp;quot; deep, in my opinion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both my nearside wheels hit it hard and I&amp;#39;ll be getting checks for damage to my wheels and tyres.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have reported it as an emergency to Gloucestershire Highways as, apart from the damage, if you were on a motorcycle or a bicycle and hit this, you&amp;#39;d likely be thrown off.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5558442.0.jpeg?93c788ec&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 139, Caernarvon Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5558442&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous hole on the pavement, 10th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5557877</link>
<description>It’s been there for well over 2 years. Several teams of different workers have used tarmac up to it and around it but no one has ever filled it.

<title>Manhole cover in Farm Lane still raised and causing flooding, 10th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5557872</link>
<description>At the junction of Farm Lane and the Old Bovey, a raised (presumably) storm drain cover is raised and continues to pour water down the road which is now starting to damage the road and causing flooding at the junction of the road with Shurdington Road. At its worst, the water also floods across Shurdington Road and makes entering the lane on foot impossible without wellies. This problem has persisted pretty much for a couple of months now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Farm Lane, Shurdington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5557872&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Light sequence incorrect., 10th February</title>

<description>Currently, the lights on this junction favour traffic from the side roads. Main road traffic, especially the vehicles coming from the main roundabout 200 yds away, is being forced to stop when unnecessary. Surely traffic on the main road in both directions should have priority??&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Greyhound Gardens, Elmbridge, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5557683&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Currently, the lights on this junction favour traffic travelling to Cheltenham AND the airport at the same time and stop all other traffic for far too long. This includes traffic travelling towards Churchdown (Main Road). Surely traffic on the main road in both directions should have priority??

<description>Pedestrian crossing just outside Halfords, SE carriageway side, has tactile paving slabs for partially sighted people. One of the slabs is rocking and loose, resulting in a raised lip and a dip, causing a potential trip hazard right next to the road.

<title>Pot hole on Lobleys bridge over M5, 10th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5557443</link>
<description>This pothole is on the side of the road going from Abbeymead to Cooper&amp;#39;s Edge. I have reported it 3 times before and it&amp;#39;s been filled in but the &amp;#39;fix&amp;#39; soon breaks up leaving the pot hole. Please fix properly, it&amp;#39;s such a waste of tax payers cash bodging the job each time. Would also like to know why this constantly occurs, is there an issue with the bridge?
