<title>Sustained damage problem, 28th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5362275</link>
<description>24/12/23 email rcvd - On the A435 at Gotherington Cross (What 3 words: allergy.withdrew.calculate)  there are bollards in the middle of the road either side of the junction. I assume they are meant to be reflective but they are filthy dirty and you can’t seem them until the last minute at night, especially on dipped headlights. This is a nasty car smash waiting to happen when some fast driver decides to overtake. They have been like this for a few weeks now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please action this with urgency.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Regards&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5362275&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Second keep left sign now demolished, 28th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5362091</link>
<description>The temporary keep left a board sign was stood back up, but because it was damaged previously, it was only stood up on three out of four legs. The sign fell over within 24 hours. Not a great fix. Two days ago the remaining keep left sign was driven over, over the top of the temporary keep left board sign that had fallen back down. Now there are no keep left signs and people are driving into the holes in the island.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5362091.0.jpeg?73501393&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Whittington Court Lane, Whittington, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5362091&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Streetlight completely obscured by enormous hedge. Dangerous for cyclists and motorists as cannot see edge of road or even most of the left-hand carriageway in the dark, 28th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5360406</link>
<description>As you go down Moorend Rd, towards the park on the left and up to the junction with the A435. It is just before the park entrance on the left as the road dips down into the hollow. The hedge is now something like 25ft high, basically as high as the lamppost it&amp;#39;s obscuring and all the other lampposts are going to be obscured as well. Please, as a matter of urgency due to the danger posed, would you get the owner of the property to cut the hedge right back all along its length, not just around that one lamppost otherwise you&amp;#39;ll be coming back to do the job again and again. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Moorend Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5360406&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
