<title>Hedge overhanging Charlton Court Road, Cheltenham, 2nd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5525305</link>
<description>Hedge cutting took place recently on the mid part of the road by a council worker, who explained to me that it was not possible for him, to cut back the higher branches that interfere with the progress of higher sided vehicles because that role is reserved for the County Council ! Larger vehicles have to pull out, even towards the bends in the road and by parked vehicles. For years the Council&amp;#39;s road sweeping vehicle has been unable to clean the gutter under the hedge because of the overhanging hedge.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 15, Charlton Court Road, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5525305&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Red triangular &#39;Pedestrians in road ahead&#39; sign (see https://hirstsigns.co.uk/product/pedestrians-in-road-ahead) twisted on post - presumably by vandals - and facing window of adjacent house (on corner) rather than traffic., 2nd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5523438</link>
<description>Staggered crossroads at junction of Lansdown Walk and Lansdown Place Lane, Cheltenham. Postcode = GL50 2LJ, What3Words = soccer.lives.sage .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note that the adjacent house on corner has been built since this sign was installed, largely blocking the view of it to traffic coming from the E end of Lansdown Place Lane. Ideally, to be visible to traffic, this sign would be better mounted on the opposite side of Lansdown Place Lane, by the white corner house and the &amp;#39;LANSDOWN PLACE LANE&amp;#39; street nameplate.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5523438.0.jpeg?2c652e5e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 9, Lansdown Place Lane, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5523438&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous signalling with respect to using signalled crossing, 2nd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5522947</link>
<description>During rush-hour, traffic dangerously obstructs the crossing point of the sole set of signalled crossing lights at the Hucclecote Road/Folland Avenue junction. This is a daily occurance; I use the crossing with my child. They often ask why a car is blocking or partially blocking the crossing, whilst I am trying to teach them that green means pedestrians can cross safely. There must be solution to this daily and potentially dangerous problem. A box junction, or reconfiguring the timing of the lights may be solutions?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5522947.0.jpeg?6ceb48ca&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hucclecote Road, Hucclecote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5522947&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Streetlights have not worked between the main entrance (3) of the university and going towards the moorend roundabout. It is pitch black, dangerous to pedestrians, joggers and cyclists. As a woman who has to walk my dog before work early in the morning I feel very vulnerable as it is so dark. The lights have been out for at least 3 weeks. An accident will happen if not fixed., 1st February</title>
