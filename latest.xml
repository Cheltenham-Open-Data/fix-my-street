<title>Tree is damaged problem, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395300</link>
<description>FMS rcvd 30.12.23 - Every time there is wind the tree sheds branches which fall onto our driveway. This poses a risk to our children, people waiting at the bus stop and also to our cars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We would ask that the tree is fully checked and dead branches removed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate a response on this issue as it has been an ongoing concern for safety.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395300&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>A board belonging to BOOKS &amp; INK obstructing the pavement, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395004</link>
<description>In the MIDDLE of the pavement outside Books &amp;amp; Ink. 6 North St, Winchcombe. I went in ti ask the female owner if she could please relocate the board. She was very challenging, saying that someone had moved it. Si I said I could wait while she repositioned it to a place which would allow the safe passage of mums with pushchairs, disabled folks in mobility scooters and wheelchair users. She didn&amp;#39;t move saying again that someone had moved it. I told her I myself had just had to walk in the road around it. She just sneered saying it was better than parked cars. I didn&amp;#39;t actually see the relevance of that. She really embarrassed herself but after quite a while she did go and move it slightly. Passive aggressive....&amp;quot;you have a lovely new year too&amp;quot;. I feel that she will put it again on the pavement causing an obstruction....merely because she is that way out.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 13a, North Street, Winchcombe, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5395004&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Path/Way doesn&#39;t match map problem, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5393975</link>
<description>I manage Crickley Hill nature reserve and we are planning some tree felling work to improve the habitat for adders (among others). There is an old pedestrian gate on the south side of Cold Slad Lane (near Clair-de-Lune House, GL3 4UQ) marked by a question mark on the screenshot below. The gate hasn’t been used for a long time, and doesn’t go anywhere, just into impassable scrub and trees. It isn’t marked on the online GCC PRoW map (where the screenshot is from), but I’m aware the online map isn’t definitive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;I was wondering if you could confirm whether or not there is a public right of way at this location?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5393975&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Very large trees overhanding and dropping branches, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5390917</link>
<description>Good morning, Yesterday i reported an issue with blocked road side drains and water flooding down our side road to &amp;#39;Sheepshead Row&amp;#39; now called &amp;#39;leckhmapton Lodge&amp;#39;. Please also note, the trees on the main road, also coming down our drive (this is also public highway and IS NOT a private road) are hugely overgrown and branches keep falling on the road which have to be moved. The used to be cut regularly, however, haven&amp;#39;t been for some 3/4 years now and are dangerous. The road, leading to Field Cottage is also a public footpath which bring with it a danger to life when windy.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5390917.0.png?d5259479&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kidnappers Lane, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5390917&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
