<title>Several deep sharp edged potholes at location, 1st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3721112</link>
<description>The location is the Cleeve Common Road going towards the common on a bend where there is a gate going into the woods on the left hand side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The potholes are right in the wheel track so it is difficult to avoid them and definitely could cause damage to tyres. The side of the road is also eroded on the right hand side and as this is a bit of a pinch point for two vehicles trying to pass each other can this be repaired as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can this area be filled in.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3721112&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overgrown trees and bushes partially blocking shared cycle/footpath, 31st July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3720616</link>
<description>The vegetation has grown to the extent that there is barely room to cycle along the path, and no room to pass oncoming cycles or pedestrians. This is likely to cause an accident due to the lack of proper upkeep of the right of way.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): A40, Barnwood&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3720616&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Possible water leak, 30th July</title>

<description>This corner is permanently wet, even through the recent hot spell, leaving a long roughly two foot puddle on the bend. It seems to be flowing away down the hill without crossing the road but I suspect that there is a leaky pipe somewhere nearby which Severn Trent Water might be interested in.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 2 The View The View, Cleeve Hill&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3718401&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fire hazard!, 29th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3716880</link>
<description>This tree has never been cared for, it now has 25years worth of pine needles and cones under it and is surrounded by tall dry weeds! When the grass is cut nobody ever trims around it! Now it needs a complete make over! This tree overhangs my garden and would set fire to my shrubs and quickly spread to properties. The children are now on holiday and sometimes sneak under there to smoke etc. Rubbish is often tipped there too! Please get it sorted and tidied up, its a beautiful tree but in its current state is a hazard!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/3716880.0.jpeg?2e3502fe&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 20 Barley Close, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3716880&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerously overgrown trees, 27th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3710211</link>
<description>Since I bought my property in 2019 the trees lining the alleyway at the back of my property have never been maintained. And are now a danger to the public and to the home owners at the bottom of Draycot road (park end). The trees are clearly lining the alley way and should be maintained as the others in the park are. However this hasn’t happened. The trees now are very tall, to tall to be directly behind a property. They are also planted on the alleyway vege and as you can see from the photo the soil has eroded out beneath them making them not only huge but very unstable. The last few storms we have had have caused the trees to bend and away dangerously. They are also all covered in ivy which has caused a few to die… again this means the trees are not stable and have the potential to come down on the houses or people walking up the alley. The alley way is used by school children daily and I am starting to worry that branches could snap off and injure someone. Please can you urgently send someone to look at the trees. Since I moved in the trees have grown at least 6-8 feet and the roots are now very exposed. I’m very very concerned that one if not more of the trees are going to fall down and potentially have catastrophic results.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/3710211.0.jpeg?3e708f73&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 28 Draycot Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3710211&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
