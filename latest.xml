<title>Road cracking due to subsidence, 1st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5273376</link>
<description>The tree is oversized and apparently was planted without a root barrier (which other tree have in the road - this was a replacement tree for one which died shortly after planting). There has also been a bund dug in the open space to avoid flooding and these two issues would appear to have caused the ground under the road to move and create the crack. The Parish council are removing the tree but asked me to report this to you as the road cracking is considered to be subsidence as there are several other examples around the estate. Bloor Homes have confirmed that under the S38 agreement, all the estate roads are now the responsibility of Gloucestershire County Council.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5273376.0.jpeg?7c0cec8c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hurricane Drive, Stoke Orchard, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5273376&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

This has been reported before but was deemed safe! A lady on her mobility scooter had to reverse back as she could not negotiate it. How can this be deemed safe.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5269763.0.jpeg?5deb59e7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Keepers Mill, Woodmancote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5269763&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Brockworth Bridleway 60 - path muddy beyond resurfacing, 30th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5269758</link>
<description>The recent repair works to get rid of the muddy section of the Brockworth bridleway 60 has improved the path way, and resolved much of the problems, however, muddy sections, continue further along the path, it requested that you extend the works at the very least to the junction with the unadopted pathway leading to Bamel Way on the Gloucester business Park. Without this work, the path is still inconvenient to users of route during all seasons of the year. Given its urban location of this route, there is a need to take greater consideration of the needs of all users, including those who might try to use the route using motorised scooters and the like. In determining your prioritisation of this, I would draw your attention to the fact that this is a critical piece of infrastructure to provide access to community services based on the business Park due to your inability to adopt a roots via golf course road to the business Park from the Spinners Road ecetera development at the rear of Invista&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5269758.0.jpeg?9f3ee607&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Spinners Road, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5269758&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
