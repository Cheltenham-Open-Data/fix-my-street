<title>Broken bridge slats, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412690</link>
<description>These have been reported in a number of occasions before and the matter has not been resolved and is becoming quite dangerous. 3-4 slats are completely missing and are a serious risk if I just. This needs URGENT attention as it is a vital thoroughfare. Please make an effort to resolve this before it becomes an emergency. Suggest you check ALL slats rather than just bridge the existing problem.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gevum Way, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412690&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Grass verge needs cutting so that I can cut my hedge, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412181</link>
<description>The verge on the Shurdington Road between Silverthorne Close and Kenelm Gardens needs cutting urgently. Our house at 67 Merestones Drive has gated access and we are trying to sell our house. I cannot cut my hedge on the road side due to this and it is full of litter and a major eyesore which is not helping our house sale. This used to be lawn which I looked after until the pavement was made wider and nobody appears to be looking after it now. Please can you cut all the weeds down as soon as possible. Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shurdington Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6412181&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Traffic lights and previous signage obscured by trees&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cllr: See email below - I travelled this road yesterday and can confirm that coming from the Cheltenham direction you can&amp;#39;t see the traffic lights until you are very near them.&amp;#10;Vegetation needs to be cut back not just at the traffic lights themselves please but also in the run up to them so that drivers can see in advance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I reported vegetation obscuring traffic lights and signage on A40 at Shipton Olliffe at the end of July via FixMyStreet...   (Received update that work had been done)...I have just been up to check and from the photos you can see nothing has been done. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Full email with photos attached)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Relates to 11463930/42540310)&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6411186&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocking visibility on road/junction (Grass/verge) problem, 29th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6410863</link>
<description>It is overgrown and encourages litter. &amp;#10;My question to you is -&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Why are we being treated differently to the residents who live in other parts of the village? We feel we are being discriminaed against just because of where we live. We pay the same council tax so should therefore expect the same level of service.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have been raising this issue since June and your customer service team promised an additional cut which has just not happened. &amp;#10;Many residents mow some of the area themselves. I mow infront of 6 houses as my neighbours are elderly and would have to pay for someone to do it. &amp;#10;Many of the areas are not directly infront of anyone&amp;#39;s property so are left. &amp;#10;One lady at the end of Crown Drive pays someone to maintain the triangle of grass and bushes. Surely this is not right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I appreciate there is a cost implication but surely we should all be treated the same. &amp;#10; &amp;#10;I look forward to your response. &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6410863&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
