<title>Cars parking right up to blind spot round from Birdlip to Brimpsfield, 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499994</link>
<description>Going through Birdlip round to the bend towards Brimpsfield cars are parking right up to the corner. Lines are faded and going that way has potential to drive into car coming round the bend from Brimpsfield. It is more concerning due to the amount of traffic coming from Brimpsfield and number of larger vehicles. There is just no where to go and coming from Birdlip you have to commit to going through as no gaps to pull in. To be fair it has only been recently cars have parked there but every day the last few week ps in rush hour it has been a concern. I notice a similar issue around this area was reported but stating itâ€™s closed so wanted to highlight it as it is such a blind bend and people drive fast around that corner. Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ermin Way, Birdlip, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499994&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>My 89 year old father fell due to this pot hole. He was walking slowly and was very lucky not to be seriously hurt. It could have resulted in hospitalisation. He was dizzy afterwards as he has a weak heart. It is dangerous for any elderly people. My mum has had a hip replacement and has sight loss. They live locally and walk this route several times a week., 27th January</title>

<title>Dangerous parking, 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499889</link>
<description>Car owners park their cars on the south side of Westfield Avenue despite having driveways that they could park on. This has the effect of forcing drivers on to the wrong side of the road as they are approaching the blind corner on this junction. People driving in the opposite direction, from Ermin Park onto Westfield Ave tend to take this corner at speed, only to be confronted with oncoming traffic on their side of the road. This has been an issue for 5+ years. Serious accident as a result in 2018 but no action taken. Double yellow lines needed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5499889.0.jpeg?343f38fb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westfield Avenue, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499889&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Just off the main Cotswold Way (OS Explorer map 179 at approx grid ref 133194) as you turn eastwards off the path and diagonally upwards on another main path towards a private house/track and a Gloucestershire Wildlife information board about Buckholt Wood a couple of hundred metres away. A very large tree (requires a chainsaw, tree is several feet in circumference and about 40 ft high) has fallen and completely blocked the path. It is not possible to go round the blocked path as the tree is so large it continues to block the path for many many metres on either side. You have to be able to climb over not only the tree trunk but also a mass of branches blocking the path to a height of a couple of feet. Most walkers will find it simply impossible to get by., 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499113</link>
<description>As stated above. I can&amp;#39;t say how long the problem has been there, but the crack in the trunk may be several weeks old only. However, another walker has seen it before but didn&amp;#39;t know how to report it! As I&amp;#39;ve said previously to you this link I&amp;#39;m using is not what comes up if you search on the web for how to report a footpath problem.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Buckholt Road, Cranham, Stroud&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5499113&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
