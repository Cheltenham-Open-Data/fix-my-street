<title>Previously fix pot hole crumbling, 16th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5587217</link>
<description>This was fixed some months ago and is now a pot hole again. It is clear and obvious that the repair work is not fit for purpose or to standard if it only lasts months at a time. Interesting also just around the corner a previous pot hole fixed only weeks ago has degraded into another pot hole (this has been reported) this isn’t by chance it’s common sense that the repair work wasn’t carried out properly. Pot hole repairs should not last months or weeks if done right!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Innsworth Lane, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5587217&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Very dangerous series of potholes in Priors Road, 16th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5586339</link>
<description>From Sainsbury&amp;#39;s north to B4632 there are a series of deep potholes. Busy traffic swerves to avoid them and results in many near collisions. This is the worst set of potholes I have seen and I am writing to the MP, with photos.The last repair here was highly substandard and reflects very poorly on the council. If my wheels/tyres are damaged I will claim.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 263, Priors Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5586339&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Potholes all over the roads, 16th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5585841</link>
<description>There are multiple pothole all over Gloucester Road from the train station up to St Georges Road. I live on Gloucester road so I have to go through this road at least 3-4 times a day. The road is awful, it really needs some care to get up to standards. My car gets absolutely ruined driving all over those potholes. You also cannot avoid them as you could crash into other cars coming from the opposite way. Please look into repairing this road as soon as possible. This issue has been reported multiple times by the residents in this area and nothing has been done about it so far.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 206, Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5585841&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Footpath from Hunters Road to Stoke Road . Used to have a step but now a slope,, dangerous for old people to navigate.
