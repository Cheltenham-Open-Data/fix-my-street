<title>Potholes across Road, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4108680</link>
<description>The location is the Cleeve Common Road just past the entrance to the Old Quarry / Dry Pool Farm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two potholes have opened up - one either side of the road and right in the vehicle wheel tracks such that it is impossible to miss them. The road between the potholes also seems to be braking up to form a shallow &amp;#39;trench&amp;#39;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can these be filled in such that it stops the holes reopening as quite a few vehicles use this road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Cleeve Common, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4108680&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>2 large pot holes, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4107870</link>
<description>Large pot holes outside number 6 and number 8 Linworth Road. The holes are that deep there is a lot of debris left over the road which keeps hitting our vehicles. These have been there since before Christmas but everytime they are filled they come out a few weeks later. This is by a school so the traffic is really bad and is causing a lot of damage now. We shouldn’t have to keep sweeping the pavement/road everyday. The road is bad and then flicks the stones up at my car and then it covered the pavement which is going to do a school child an injury sooner or later. Please sort&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 8 Linworth Road, Bishops Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4107870&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Stay Left Bollard no longer bolted down, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4103813</link>
<description>The Stay Left Bollard protecting the crossing outside the Smith and Mann shop on Lyefield Road East with a blue arrow was knocked over approximately a year ago. It is the type where the bolts are designed to break on impact, it may be possible to replace the bolts without replacing the entire bollard and base. The brand name on it is &amp;quot;Visaboll&amp;quot; as in the photos. It is a thin and lightweight bollard and without the bolts when the wind blows it falls over.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4103813.0.png?12808e51&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 66 Copt Elm Road, Charlton Kings&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4103813&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
