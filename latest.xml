<description>Can only select one blocked gully on your map, but there are MANY.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heavy flooding (as of 7:45am today) at the pedestrian crossing on A40 Lansdown Road, close to junction with Shelburne Road, due to MULTIPLE BLOCKED GULLIES.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crossing is effectively unusable due to water halfway out into road carriageway. Pedestrians also at risk of a soaking as passing traffic drives through standing water.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;EVERY gully on BOTH SIDES of A40 from railway bridge through to Westal Green (Texaco filling station) need cleaning out - many are blocked and have been for YEARS despite repeated reporting.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shelburne Road, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6522069&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drain College Road affecting St Luke&#39;s Road, 26th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6521257</link>
<description>The drain indicated on the map does not work so water flows into St Luke&amp;#39;s Road (from College Rd) where it sits alongside the curb, unable to drain away into any of the drains in this part of St Luke&amp;#39;s Road. It is often quite deep so not easy to access our cars without getting wet feet. Also, weeds and plants are growing happily as earth, leaves etc are also swept into the area. This is not the first time there has been a complaint. Although the Council sprayed weed killer this summer after I asked for them to remove all the growth, they did not return to remove all the plants so nothing has been achieved. This problem has been ongoing since the curved pavement on College Rd (opp A&amp;amp;E entrance) was built quite a few years ago. With the recent rain its been particularly bad.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 38, College Road, Montpellier, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6521257&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The drain on the East side of Lansdown Parade appears blocked and causes significant flooding across the road and pavement., 26th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6520860</link>
<description>The drain opposite number 4 and 5 Lansdown Parade is blocked. This is an ongoing problem and has flooded the road on numerous occasions. This has been reported to Cheltenham Council previously and no action has been taken. The flooding creates significant risk for vehicles and is major hazard for pedestrians both of injuries from falling on flooded pavement as well as being soaked by spray from vehicles.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6520860.0.jpeg?68d3bc27&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 47, Lansdown Crescent, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6520860&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
