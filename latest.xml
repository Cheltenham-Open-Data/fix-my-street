<title>Red button light on pelican crossing not working, 21st July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4811598</link>
<description>The light to indicate the pedestrian button has been pressed has not been working on the north west side for a year or so. I appreciate that this does not stop the lights from changing, however, since this is heavily used by local primary school, it would be helpful if this was working correctly to help teach the children road safety.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 94, Sheldons Court, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4811598&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Significant drainage issue with gully over footway, 20th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4807205</link>
<description>Albert House on Charles Street is suffering from extreme foundational damp that&amp;#39;s causing long-term damage - it really needs a site visit and the pipes through the gully are getting blocked with water. There are two narrow drains that are missing metal covers and they&amp;#39;ve been tarmacked over. In the photo I&amp;#39;ve added the tarmac has collapsed and blocked the drain entirely so no water can escape out into the roadway to drain away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could you call Steve Ayres on 07917044454 to discuss the situation please? He&amp;#39;s a property manager and has been trying to resolve this for ages. Thanks so much, Tabi&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4807205.0.jpeg?aca89ed9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 13, Charles Street, St Paul’s, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4807205&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Travellers, 20th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4806414</link>
<description>Travellers have started turning up next to the kids play area. As scruffy as Cheltenham looks already this makes it look worse and we all know that they will make noise and leave a mess. Right on top of the school holidays. It means that many people will stop using the park and will stop walking their dogs in that area.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 8, Gristmill Close, Springbank, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4806414&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>A portion of the road surface in Apple Tree Close (by No 10) has been marked for repair, but if you look along this stretch of road there is more surface missing than there is present!
