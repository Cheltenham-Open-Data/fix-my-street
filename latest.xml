<title>The entire strip off road is covered in deep potholes, 15th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5325934</link>
<description>The road leading to home farm and 2 other property’s leading from Brockhampton lane is completely covered in deep potholes and has been getting progressively worse over the past couple of years I myself have had 1 tyre repair and one tyre replacement due to the road being so bad and is only fit to drive 5mph. This road is used by lots of caravans as a business and holds horses and other live stock and it’s very uneven and unsafe for the trailers towing them. Please can you confirm when you will be able to review and repair this section of road as it’s not fit to high safety standards thank you I look to your reply&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockhampton Lane, Kingsditch, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5325934&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Parking on the path, 15th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5323246</link>
<description>This is opposite the grangfield school in bishops cleeve. People park there damaging the grass and leaving it all horrible and muddy. Also I live on the Highgrove and Cars parked there completely block the view when trying to pull up to main road. I nearly had car crash. Maybe metal barriers will prevent people from parking.

<title>Fly tipping from builders, 15th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5323071</link>
<description>2 or 3 houses on Mead Road were having their retaining wall rebuilt which backs onto the footpath. Builders have only half finished the job and now deserted the site. Rubbish has been left behind. The path is ruined, too boggy and muddy to walk through. Evidence of fly tipping from photographs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5323071.0.jpeg?f98018ce&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 56, Mead Road, Naunton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5323071&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Foothpath impassable, 15th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5323038</link>
<description>The houses on Mead road were having a wall built which backs onto the footpath. The builders have churned up the path by using a digger on this path. This is a key route for school children and it is so churned up/muddy that we cannot go this way. It has been like this for weeks. There is evident fly tipping and the whole area affected is a disgrace. No permission was sought for this work. No workmen have been seen for weeks. It has been left in an awful state and not fit for purpose&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5323038.0.jpeg?3f2baa5f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 54, Mead Road, Naunton, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5323038&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Damaged road tarmac causing high drop kerb, 15th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5322777</link>
<description>I have reported this issue numerous times down the years and nothing is ever done. Where the tarmac has eroded over time the drop kerb to our drive is no longer an acceptable drop kerb and is like driving up an actual kerb to get on to our drive! It&amp;#39;s clear that a big factor in this is the gully cleaning - they have been round today to clear the leaves from the road gullies but I can see this has damaged the tarmac, and even outside one of the neighbouring properties made a hole in the road! The road needs to be repaired so we can drive on to our driveways without damaging our cars. In the 10 years or so we&amp;#39;ve been here we&amp;#39;ve had 4 new exhausts fitted which I&amp;#39;m sure is as a result of driving up and down a kerb to get on our driveway.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Notley Place, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5322777&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
