<title>Multiple houses Rain water run off pipe blocked due to the stream drain exit point blocked, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5142154</link>
<description>7 Chapel lane drain access overflowed due to high volume of rain during the recent storm causing damage to our drive way by lifting foundation of the drive displacing block paving.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Private drain company came to investigate blockage and identified that the exit point in the adjacent stream is blocked due stream sediment level covering the exit point.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chapel Lane, Woodmancote, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5142154&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>OPen trench across garden road liable to cause serious accident,, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5141909</link>
<description>The whole width of Garden Road road was dug up today by BT. The open trench has been covered by a number of heavy yellow plates, but every time a vehicle goes over, the plates move. When I walked past a little while ago much of the trench was uncovered, creating a terrible hazard for vehicles, and especially cycles/motorcycles as there is no hazard lighting to give warning.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 8, Garden Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5141909&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Traffic lights not allowing enough time for cyclists going uphill, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5141789</link>
<description>The last 3 times (Oct 23rd, 24th, 25th) that I cycled through this section heading North I&amp;#39;ve gone through the lights either as they&amp;#39;ve turned green or very shortly after they turned green. Each time the other end had turned green before I passed it. This is extremely dangerous - I reported it on the 5th of October too - the timing on these lights is not safe and needs to be changed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;None of the categories available to report this issue seem suitable, I&amp;#39;ll just plump for one.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Badgeworth Road, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5141789&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Car parked over private entrance markings (H markings), 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5141648</link>
<description>As stated on GCC website ‘a private entrance H marking should not be used as reserved parking’ This vehicle is always on the road on the white markings. On a weekday morning the obstruction to the carriageway causes terrible queues all the way down Brookfield Road in both directions as vehicles struggle to pass freely. This is an ongoing issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5141648.0.jpeg?a0973714&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brookfield Road, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5141648&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
