<title>Tree roots blocking drains 3 oldbury road, 20th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6637567</link>
<description>Sorry previously submitted issue but it was closed and I have responded to your email but it now stays the email is not manned and to send here again. Hi Thank you for your response, I understand however the drain on our property is completely blocked of roots from the tree on the pavement outside the front of our home.( this is not in our control) It is my understanding that the tree falls under the highways care and that you are required to complete any maintenance work from said tree after it has been reported. I understand you have put a job on for when you have more funding but what happens untill then. I would like to know where i stand If there is damage to my property from the drains flooding due to the work not being completed as you are waiting for funding, who will then foot the bill, or do we need to pay for a private firm to remove the roots and then send across the bill to someone at highways? Please could you let me know what to do next?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Oldbury Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6637567&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>On the crossroads between shurdington road and Moorend park road and big divot is opening up.
