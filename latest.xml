<title>Damaged tree from recent storm, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5421441</link>
<description>On A436 heading from Andoversford towards Bourton and before Shipton turnoff.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tree/very large bush looks damaged from recent storm and is protruding slightly into the road but also as the shape of this bush/tree has changed, it also looks like a higher large branch may be leaning and at risk of falling into the road. This would be dangerous as this roads has bends and this would not be a good spot to be avoiding a fallen branch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cannot take a photo as it is dangerous to stop on this stretch of road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A436, Andoversford, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5421441&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large pothole at end of Corpus Street (London Road end) by parking zone, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5420579</link>
<description>The pothole was reported and allegedly fixed (FixMyStreet ref: 5198046) but has reappeared in an even worse state, deteriorating over the last few weeks. It&amp;#39;s also in the parking zone bay meaning there are fewer places to park as the area can no longer be used due to the severity of the pothole.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5420579.0.jpeg?50eb2a45&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 37, High Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5420579&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Appalling potholed and damaged road surface over an extended area along the busy Priors Road from Prestbury Road all the way along to the junction with Bouncers Lane.
