<title>Very large trees overhanding and dropping branches, 4th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5390917</link>
<description>Good morning, Yesterday i reported an issue with blocked road side drains and water flooding down our side road to &amp;#39;Sheepshead Row&amp;#39; now called &amp;#39;leckhmapton Lodge&amp;#39;. Please also note, the trees on the main road, also coming down our drive (this is also public highway and IS NOT a private road) are hugely overgrown and branches keep falling on the road which have to be moved. The used to be cut regularly, however, haven&amp;#39;t been for some 3/4 years now and are dangerous. The road, leading to Field Cottage is also a public footpath which bring with it a danger to life when windy.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5390917.0.png?d5259479&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kidnappers Lane, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5390917&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>New surface, laid 2 weeks ago, has already been washed out by water running down the hill, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5389510</link>
<description>On the recently laid and widened bridlepath from Crippetts Lane towards Greenway Lane. The granite ‘dust’ has already been washed away in places - and the kerb drains are full of granite dust and can’t work. Not sure if this is a design issue - not coping with the level of water, or a construction issue. Sad to think that the money and time spent on this has only lasted 2 weeks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5389510.0.jpeg?ee2f880a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Crippetts Lane, Leckhampton, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5389510&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
