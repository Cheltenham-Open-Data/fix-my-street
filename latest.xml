<title>Existing problem that planned repair won’t fix, 3rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7080151</link>
<description>Ref enquiry 22068997 Your response was: This will be continued to be monitored by our safety Inspection policy, the dropped kerb in question would have been installed by the property owner, they must remain 1m away from the drain and the streetlight, which is why this has been widened further when this would have been installed and can’t be widened any further. This is also due to overriding and parking on the verge, the effect is in for topsoil verge area, but if is driven over this will continue to happen unfortunately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However in response to this I just want some points clarified. You say a drop kerb cannot be 1m away from a drain or street light. As you can see from the picture the drop kerb is already directly adjacent to a drain. No one parks on this area as you suggest, as this would block my drive, but yes overdriving happens on a regular basis because we have to drive over the verge to access our property. The drop kerb is not fit for purpose. If the verge was tarmac’d rather than soiled/seeded this would prevent further erosion. I guarantee soil and seed will be eroded in days. A waste of time and Highways money. Widening the drop kerb by a slight amount would in no way place it any closer to a drain or light than it already is. Please review and contact me to discuss if possible on 07484816659 or email gazlucy@yahoo.co.uk Thank you Gary&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7080151.0.jpeg?b0c00a09&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 49, Beeches Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7080151&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>There is a very big deep pothole in this road, 3rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7079228</link>
<description>There is a very big pothole in Kyderminster Road that is dangerous and needs attending to. There are also a number of significant other holes that also need attending to ASAP. I reported a number of potholes last June and a few were repaired but this road has deteriorated worse than before. Can you give this your urgent attention before a car has an accident hitting this hike or a child hurts themselves crossing the road. Ideally the whole of Kyderminster Road needs resurfacing as does Huddleston Road where the surface is disintegrating&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Huddleston Road, Winchcombe, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7079228&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
