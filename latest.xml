<description>Earth is being dropped on the road and pavement, from the current development. No attempt has been made to clean it up. In addition to the vehicles regularly being parked on the pavement (van, earth moving lorries, developers), this is regularly obstructing the pavement, particularly for some members of the community.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/3310002.0.jpeg?69e9f645&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Two Gables Hailes Street, Winchcombe&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3310002&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3307826</link>
<description>I organised a parish council litter pick. We have put all other bags into the large waste bin at swindon village hall. This needs emptying. There is 1 remaining bag at the memorial bench on manor road green area, with rubbish removed from the watercourse that I was not able to put in the village Hall bin. Please arrange for this to be collected by Ubico.. In addition, there is fly tipping behind the electricity substation on the other side of manor road and also at the entrance to dog bark lane. Please have the same team remove this. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Manor Road, Swindon Village&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3307826&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3303624</link>
<description>The location is Ham Lane Charlton Kings. The area is now walked by a relatively high number of Dog Walkers.

Other examples have already been picked up by residents.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/3303624.0.jpeg?6d2a2b3f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Cornerstone Ham Lane, Charlton Kings&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/3303624&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
