<title>2 very large areas of road have literally come away since all the rain., 12th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5568250</link>
<description>Heading towards Shurdington, just inside the 50MPH zone. 2 very large areas of road have crumbled away. Can&amp;#39;t avoid hitting them or you’d be on the other side of the carriageway. Very dangerous as road not lit so no chance of seeing them when dark. The same area, very near these potholes, was only repaired by a road closure around 6 months ago !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Badgeworth Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5568250&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Awful dangerous pothole on Birdlip roundabout travelling towards ullenwood turning, 12th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5567960</link>
<description>I use this road to get to Birdlip every weekday, and have used this route for 6 years. The potholes have been really really dreadful for ages but are now just unbelievable. The one I encountered today as I travelled to Leckhampton was so bad it caused my wheel to crack at the impact, I can’t see it’s damaged but cd well have cracked or weakened my alloy. I will inspect further in the daylight tmw. There is no paint on the pothole and it’s right in the wheel area of cars. I am constantly having to move into the centre of the road morning and night to avoid these potholes that are literally littering this stretch of road. There WILL be a very serious accident very soon due to so many cars going into the rd centre to avoid them. I just can’t believe you can feel it is acceptable to leave this road in this awful neglected condition. It’s a death trap for cars and people&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): B4070, Coberley, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5567960&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
