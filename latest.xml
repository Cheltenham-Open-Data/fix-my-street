<title>Holes in road from removal of studs/markings, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5436438</link>
<description>On the B4063 between the fire station and entrance to Pirton Fields there are holes in the road from the removal of studs/road markings prior to the cycle lane being installed. These are noticeable holes that ideally require filling at least temporarily. It could be argued that the road needs attention since the works to install the cycle lane has caused a patchwork surface.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cheltenham Road East, Churchdown, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5436438&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No-parking cones been put on the road with no notice of authorisation., 12th January</title>

<description>A length of North Road East has had a number of no-parking cones put out along both sides of the road. There are no notices of any authorisation of parking restrictions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a road race on Sunday, they have apparently ’applied for’ permission, but in previous years have ‘closed’ the road with no authorisation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Even if it is for Sunday, blocking the road from Friday afternoon does not seem acceptable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cones were so close together that I couldn’t even safely pull in to let someone past before I reversed into my drive today.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): North Road East, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5435132&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
