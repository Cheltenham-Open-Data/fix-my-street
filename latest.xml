<title>Obstructed path following Environment Agency Flood Alleviation Scheme completed 2012, 30th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6417458</link>
<description>The planning scheme for the flood alleviation scheme submitted by the Environment Agency included proposals for the extinguishment of parts of two paths and the diversion of EHU5 and EHU3. This was granted consent by Tewkesbury Borough on 9 December 2010 under planning reference 10/00893/FUL.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An application was also made by Tewkesbury Borough Council (10/00894/FTP) for the diversion of parts of EHU 3 and EHU5 footpaths along with the extinguishment of parts of EHU3 and EHU2A under Town and Country Planning Act 1990 powers as the changes were necessary to enable the development to take place. The proposed changes are shown in one of the photographs attached. This was supported at the time by Hucclecote Parish Council and consultation had taken place with the Gloucester Group of the Ramblers Association, details of this consultation are included in the design and access statement to the planning application.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This application is now problematic as Town and Country Planning powers to divert/extinguish routes only exist before the development is “substantially complete” and in the normal course of events resolving this problem would require a new application under Highways Act powers. Four public authorities were involved in this project – Gloucestershire County Council, Gloucester City Council, the Environment Agency and Tewkesbury Borough Council. The evidence suggests that the Environment Agency made reasonable endeavours to resolve this matter. As Tewkesbury Borough Council did not progress the rights of way application it bears a high degree of responsibility for this. I have made a formal complaint on behalf of the Open Spaces Society, asking them to make the order under Highways Act powers at their own cost. I am in correspondence with a Senior Planning Compliance Officer at TBC who is currently taking legal advice from One Legal.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6417458.0.jpeg?bbe3c2fb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gilpin Avenue, Hucclecote, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6417458&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Good afternoon I was wondering what was happening with the footpath closure reference as above in Abbotswood Road Brockworth EY102GH1901000029464, 30th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6417339</link>
<description>This has been closed for several weeks, the problem is that there really isn&amp;#39;t an issue. Moreover there is no viable alternative route as the alternative is to walk on the grass verge or in the road. I believe that closure of the footpath is a greater hazard than it is solving. It would be ridiculous to impose road traffic restrictions to accommodate this folly. I look forward to you comments.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Abbotswood Road, Brockworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6417339&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Excessive flyposting/advertising on Swindon road, 30th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6417325</link>
<description>Swindon Road, Cheltenham. Travelling from the retail park. When you crest the narrow/over railway bridge there are yellow advertising signs around the Swindon Road/Windyridge road junction. These are very distracting as they look like genuine highways signage. There are approx qty10 between Windridge Road and Mauds Elm roundabout. Are you able to remove them?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 373b, Swindon Road, Kingsditch, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6417325&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>When the road was resurfaced our property (30 Painswick Road) was left without a white line, 30th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6416453</link>
<description>I understand that it is possible to ask for a white line to be painted across the road where our drive is. Our neighbours have this, recently repainted following resurfacing. As a result, people think it is OK to park in a way that blocks our drive. I know that white lines have no legal force but they are persuasive. Our local councillor (Cllr Tim Harman) advises that for a small fee we can get our part of the road painted too. Can we ask that this be done and how much is the fee?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 9, Andover Road, Tivoli, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6416453&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Light sensor is not detecting vehicles problem, 30th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6416053</link>
<description>29/08/24 email rcvd ::: Hello&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While Manor Road is closed to traffic, congestion in the Kingsditch area has become close to gridlock at some times of day.  The main access to the Gallagher retail park and the Sainsbury&amp;#39;s supermarket there is via the filters at the traffic lights at Hayden Lane.  Very long queues are developing for these filters, and the length of those phases clearly need to be increased to ease the impact on an already badly congested area.  Can you please look at making this change asap, as it seems unlikely that the roadworks will be completed in the foreseeably future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6416053&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
