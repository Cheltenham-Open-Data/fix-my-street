<title>The sign is illegible problem, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5256361</link>
<description>&amp;quot;Hello,&amp;#10;I raised this shortly after the &amp;#39;hamburger&amp;#39; alterations to Elmbridge Court roundabout. I don&amp;#39;t recall a formal reply addressing the concern back then (though there might have been !!), but I&amp;#39;d just like to put it once more to Highways that the sign on approach to Elmbridge Court rbt from Churchdown is technically inaccurate, since it omits the Elmbridge Business Park.&amp;#10;I appreciate there isn&amp;#39;t much space to add a line of text to the sign, or even add a second sign, but I did wonder if a &amp;#39;short stubby tick for a secondary road&amp;#39; - whatever such a tick is called - could be added : the kind that is still represented on the primary A road sign, showing all the B roads, sometimes unlabelled, off the roundabout.&amp;#10;The concern is that if one is unfamiliar with the area, and heading towards Cirencester A417 from Churchdown, the sign shows Cirencester as the second exit, whereas the reality is that it is the third exit ! Obviously, locals are familiar with the route, but as a driving instructor it&amp;#39;s interesting and useful to see such signs &amp;#39;afresh&amp;#39; each time as learners attempt it.&amp;#10;Kind regards,&amp;#10;Nat&amp;quot;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5256361&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Gates erected on Cotswold Way bridleway difficult for riders - 6+ gates to pass through in total!, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5255586</link>
<description>Sent on 8 August - no update or change to situation: Web Reference: PRO005605 Enquiry Number: 11430460 Issue: PROW - Obstruction Location: Site: WINCHCOMBE BRIDLEWAY 21 As detailed above, I reported this issue in August. There are so many gates along this stretch of bridleway, in reality, it makes it untenable to horse riders to use this route! I accept 4 gates with proper opening handles operational from horse back but 2 extra gates have been erected by private owner with chains to open/close and you have to dismount to get through both. These gates keep horses in paddock (although sometimes they are allowed to graze the bridleway) and they can be quite vicious to other horses/riders who use bridleway to get on to Cleeve Common. Please could you update me as I&amp;#39;ve been persevering with ALL these gates for so long and most of riders simply avoid this route now. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): B4632, Southam, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5255586&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The lane going through Elkstone Village is in desperate need of cleaning. All the debris on the lane is clogging up the (few) drains when it rains.

<title>The verges of the whole road need repair, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5255181</link>
<description>The road from Elkstone to Combend Farm and to under the under pass on BOTH sides of the road are not safe for cyclist. When cycling to and from Cirencester my safety is comprised, this road is VERY well used at peaks and often off peak times too. Dogging the numerous pot holes is dangerous especially with a vehicle wanting to overtake you. There are too many pot holes to list, the whole section of the road needs to be walk and sprayed, I cannot take photos of every problem on foot safely. When the pot holes are full of water it is even more of a problem when dark, you cannot see them as well. The evenings are dark now. I urged your immediate attention. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cockleford Road, Elkstone, Cotswold&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5255181&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Sixways traffic lights reconfiguration, 27th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5255156</link>
<description>During recent resurfacing work on the A40 it appears that the sixways traffic lights have had their timings reconfigured. The A40 itself used to have longer on green as it has the majority of the traffic. Since the resurfacing work the light configuration has changed, possibly accidentally? The A40 no longer has priority and is causing huge queues of traffic on the A40 in both directions . This is having an onward impact on all other roads in the area as people seek to avoid 7 or 8 minute queues sat at the sixways traffic lights.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Ryeworth Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5255156&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
