<title>Road works, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4209221</link>
<description>This road works has been there for weeks and is causing major traffic problems at busy times. The roundabout at Rutherford Way becomes jammed and stationary, so the traffic flowing past the road works towards the roundabout is also stationary, which means that the traffic waiting to go the other way is unable to move either, as the single lane is full. This in turn makes the congestion at the roundabout worse. It&amp;#39;s just unacceptable that this is still going on after so long, with no work being carried out at all. The contractors must be fined for this, and made to remove the blockage until they&amp;#39;re ready actually to complete the work.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Unit K2 Manor Road, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4209221&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked surface drain by Tythe Barn, 5th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4205959</link>
<description>The surface water drain outside the Tythe Barn is blocked and there is a large puddle there despite no rain for several weeks. Cars splash pedestrians on the pavement. When it rains it floods the road and is worse but I have a bigger concern that it has soap suds in it as it’s surface water. I think that the hand car wash in the Kings Head car park just along the road is draining into the surface drain. If you look into the car park you can see the soap suds are going into the Kings Head drain which I imagine feeds into the one outside the Tythe Barn as it’s down hill. Please can you investigate as pedestrians are getting wet and I believe the surface water contaminated.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Old Railway Station Yard Stoke Road, Bishops Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4205959&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
