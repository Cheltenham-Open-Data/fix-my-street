<title>The majority of the drains on Battldown Approach are blocked, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5556176</link>
<description>The majority of the drains on Battledown Approach are blocked by leaves, twigs etc that have fallen from the trees. As a result during recent heavy rain a river of water was running down the road onto Hales Road where it formed a sizeable lake that traffic couldn&amp;#39;t avoid.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5556176.0.jpeg?9f74afcf&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Battledown Approach, Ewens Farm, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5556176&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drain/collapsed underground pipe, 9th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5555689</link>
<description>Yet again, the drain at the junction of Green Lane and Cirencester Road opposite my house in Little Witcombe is blocked. Excess water is running across the road and the first signs of it are appearing in my cellar.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you please dispatch a crew to clear the drain as soon as possible. There must be a long term solution to this problem, which has been recurring for years. Members of the last crew that attended the site in January confirmed there is a collapsed drainage pipe. Given that the cause is known, why can&amp;#39;t the problem be rectified?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Green Lane, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5555689&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Pothole has been patched several times but keeps coming back. Always floods when it rains, and large traffic causes homes to shake. Holes are large enough to cause damage to vehicle suspension and causes cars to swerve.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5555615.0.jpeg?6dbc7c93&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 78, Whaddon Road, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5555615&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
