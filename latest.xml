<title>Large pothole at end of Corpus Street (London Road end) by parking zone, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5420579</link>
<description>The pothole was reported and allegedly fixed (FixMyStreet ref: 5198046) but has reappeared in an even worse state, deteriorating over the last few weeks. It&amp;#39;s also in the parking zone bay meaning there are fewer places to park as the area can no longer be used due to the severity of the pothole.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5420579.0.jpeg?50eb2a45&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 37, High Street, Fairview, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5420579&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Appalling potholed and damaged road surface over an extended area along the busy Priors Road from Prestbury Road all the way along to the junction with Bouncers Lane. This surface has been awful for many months after being reported.
