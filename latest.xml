<title>Inadequate lighting provision on Northfield Terrace, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156485</link>
<description>There are two streetlights along the length of the Terrace, neither of which provide enough light for residents to safely navigate the street. Combined with potholes, densely-parked cars, drains and litter in the road, it is challenging at night for pedestrians to use the footpath.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please might it be possible for the lighting along the Terrace to be supplemented with a third street lamp installed for continual illumination? Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4156485.0.jpeg?7187e9e6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 14 Clarence Square, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156485&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Derelict pavement on Northfield Terrace, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156470</link>
<description>The length of the pavement along the Terrace is in poor repair, with inadequately maintained painted double yellow lines, frequent incidence of cracking, rubble and broken tarmac, weeds and disintegration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please could it be examined for repair as it&amp;#39;s unsafe for residents to use and has deteriorated substantially over the past few years. Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4156470.0.jpeg?7129d157&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Clarence Lodge Clarence Square, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156470&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Uneven and patchy dangerous roadway surface, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156456</link>
<description>This whole street badly needs resurfacing across the length of it. Residents are finding the potholes a significant trip hazard, especially for young children and those with limited mobility. Would it be possible to raise this for a full resurface please as Northfield Terrace has not had one in many years and is in a state of significant disrepair. Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4156456.0.jpeg?0fba519d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Formosa House Northfield Terrace, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156456&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Substantial rubbish dumped along Honeybourne Line, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156190</link>
<description>The resident next to this property has an ongoing issue with the adjacent fence that is badly damaged and supposedly managed by Sanctuary Housing who conducted the development of the estate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There have been multiple incidences of flytipping behind the broken fence as it&amp;#39;s open access, and now there&amp;#39;s a large amount of construction equipment dumped there and covered with brambles. It seems to be self-exacerbating the longer the rubbish persists there. Would it be possible to take a look to see if it could be cleared? Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4156190.0.jpeg?040ad4c7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 41 Marsh Gardens, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156190&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Significant damage to pavement following line installation, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156148</link>
<description>The recent installation of cables/pipes along Marsh Drive has left the pavement in a really bad state - the surface is uneven and patchy, it looks unattractive and there&amp;#39;s a risk of sinkage in due course. The corporate installation workers have not done a great job tidying up after themselves, leaving loose grit and stones and displaced tarmac behind them, and the pavement the whole way along the Drive is in shabby condition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Would it be possible to liaise with whoever conducted this work to raise concerns about this and ensure they repair the damages caused? Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4156148.0.jpeg?2607c264&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 31 Marsh Gardens, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156148&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipping on Green on Ashlands Rd, 21st January</title>

<description>This rubbish was flytipped quite a while ago and has been reported by resodents to CBC previously via the Report It function on the Council&amp;#39;s website. However, as the rubbish remains, there must have been some problem. I&amp;#39;d be grateful if this rubbish could be removed ASAP.

<title>Poorly maintained footway along Hardwick Green, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156109</link>
<description>This section of land adjoining the Green managed by the University at Hardwick Campus is overgrown, impossible to walk on, covered in brambles and generally impractical for use. It may not be the council&amp;#39;s liability, but could be the University&amp;#39;s, and it&amp;#39;s making it hard for pedestrians to navigate the area especially when a footpath just vanishes. Any help you could offer would be massively appreciated, thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4156109.0.jpeg?d5ff7f3f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): Maidenhorn House Marsh Lane, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156109&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Potholes on intersection of Marsh Lane and Marsh Gardens, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156094</link>
<description>There&amp;#39;s a blind turning off Marsh Gardens and unavoidable potholes which residents are concerned by, as some motorists steer to avoid them so their cars aren&amp;#39;t damaged but don&amp;#39;t see oncoming traffic as they do so. It&amp;#39;s quite unsafe and may need fairly urgent attention to avoid an accident, please could you take a look?

<title>Poor quality footpath through Elmfield Park, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156076</link>
<description>There isn&amp;#39;t a useable pathway through Elmfield that residents can use or acess easily - it&amp;#39;s a muddy route that often ices over or becomes unusable in wet weather. Many people walk their dogs along the route but find it slippery or dangerous. Would it be possible to establish a safer pathway for people to use safely?

<title>Footpath blocked, 21st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4156017</link>
<description>There are large metal posts that are blocking access to the park and to Midwinter Drive - intending to block motorbikes but instead they cause significant access issues for people of limited mobility or with trolleys. Cyclists find it challenging to pass too. Please could a more sensitive approach be investigated?

<title>Dangerous junction, 20th January</title>

<description>Vehicles often fail to give way at this junction for road users on Pittville Crescent Lane. Visibility needs to be improved at this junction especially when coming from Albert Road. It would also help if vehicles stopped parking on the corner, forcing vehicles on the wrong side of the road before pulling out. Not a great place for vulnerable road users.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 7 Pittville Crescent Lane, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4153404&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Inconsiderate and dangerous parking, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4153185</link>
<description>Mentioned several times to parents of school children attending St Mary&amp;#39;s COE by the local headmaster. He needs more support from councillors and the local Police.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As pedestrians we have had numerous near misses with drivers not looking when alighting. The pavement and green areas are damaged badly and looks ugly, all because some don&amp;#39;t want to walk a few meters down the road! Laziness has become the new norm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most drivers who do this just sit in their cars with engines idling and on their phones, something we were told was illegal also!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps): 30 Bouncer&#39;s Lane, Prestbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4153185&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
