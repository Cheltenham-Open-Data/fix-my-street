<title>Sunken pavement causing improper drainage and pooling water outside 57/55, 10th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5302952</link>
<description>Subject: Request for Road Repairs: Driveway Curb Outside 57 and 55&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to bring to your attention a concern regarding the condition of the driveway curb outside properties 57 and 55 Bouncers Lane. I believe that some road repairs are necessary to address a specific issue that has been causing inconvenience to residents and pedestrians in the area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The problem at hand is the pooling of rainwater on the pavement due to a slight depression in the curb. It appears that the initial cause of this issue was the maneuvering of heavy fuel trucks into the nearby fuel station, which resulted in damage to the curb. While the trucks no longer engage in this maneuver, the damage caused persists, hindering the proper flow of rainwater into the nearby drain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To alleviate this problem and prevent further damage, I kindly request that the council consider raising the affected section of the driveway curb to it&amp;#39;s intended height. This adjustment would allow rainwater to flow naturally into the nearby drain, mitigating the pooling issue on the pavement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I understand that road repairs require careful consideration and planning. However, addressing this matter would not only enhance the overall safety of the area but also contribute to the preservation of the infrastructure in the long run.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your efforts in maintaining our community&amp;#39;s infrastructure and ensuring the well-being of its residents.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5302952.0.jpeg?b3af68f2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 57, Bouncers Lane, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5302952&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>RoW sign on its post has been pushed into the hedge and is now out of sight. Please note: Your RoW map shows the RoW meeting the road at a hedge. There&amp;#39;s with no possibility of scrambling through. The hidden sign is by the gateway a few metres towards the railway bridge.
