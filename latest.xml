<title>Still floods every time it rains, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6572365</link>
<description>This outside my Mum’s house at 67 Boverton Drive, she has severe mobility issues and this creates a big problem for her getting from her front gate and into my car. This has been reported several times before and I am not happy with the previous response (‘planned maintenance’ etc) without a clear timescale. This was nearly a year ago. Please advise when this will be rectified. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/6572365.0.jpeg?286b14f6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 72, Boverton Drive, Brockworth, Gloucester&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6572365&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571888</link>
<description>Hi Liam, We already reported this and you have come out but I just wanted to see if any chance this could be expedited as real risk of further flooding to our house again -interior.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just wanted to flag up that yesterday the water came really high again- up to half way up the wooden flood barrier- luckily my mother in law was here with the kids as we were both working and she put the flood barriers up and undug the leaves from the drain which helped a bit and the water didn’t get into the house. I appreciate you must be really busy but if there is any way it could be done as soon as possible we would be really grateful. Living in fear of it flooding every time we are working and it’s heavy rain! If there is anything else I can do to help our case- reporting it anywhere else or whatever- please let me know.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you very much,&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Vineyards Lane, Alstone, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571888&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The sign is illegible problem, 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571684</link>
<description>I recently went through a two-year process with the council and an insurance company about subsidence in my property. The tree at the front of the house which is on the pavement and outside my boundary was put on notice and subsequently &amp;#39;uneven pavement&amp;#39; signs have been put outside my house. These signs are leading to the following things; &amp;#10;•&amp;#9;They impede the off-road parking for properties. The signs are subsequently moved continuously either onto my front garden or against my wall. &amp;#10;•&amp;#9;There have been multiple occasions where the signs have blown over with cars driving across them.&amp;#10;•&amp;#9;As temporary and unstable signs they are a trip hazard in addition to the pavement itself. &amp;#10;As the pavements are clearly in enough disrepair to warrant signs, please could you confirm what the council intends to do to mitigate the problem? I have seen multiple people trip on the damage to the pavement caused by tree roots damage. Last year I also flagged that the root damage causes large puddles which seem also to be filling from the ground, rather than in heavy rain weather conditions. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please let me know when I can expect to hear back. &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6571684&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>email rcvd 08.10.24 - all trees there were planted next to the post lamps, when they grown they cover all the light from lamps and make the street and pavement very dark and unsafe.... Even nore unsafe as we had few incidents at the area which you should be aware of. &amp;#10;I would like to ask to arrange some pruning/cutting those trees to make us feel safer when coming back from work/school as now start to getting dark so early.&amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/6570834&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
