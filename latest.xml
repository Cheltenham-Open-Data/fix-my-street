<title>Grass Cutting, 16th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5000927</link>
<description>The grass verges in this area have not been cut for over 4 weeks, under guidelines issued (below) it is supposed to be done fortnightly. I have seen some residents have cut sections themselves. This is not right as we pay for this to be done. Also on the green is a tree stump that is 600mm high and quite dangerous considering children play here, and god forbid a child falling onto it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Maintenance of grass verges Grass verges are the responsibility of Gloucestershire County Council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Cheltenham, the verges are maintained by Ubico (the borough council&amp;#39;s contractor) under an agency agreement with the county council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The county council pay the borough council a contribution for five cuts per year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The borough council has agreed to fund an additional ten cuts per year which enables a cycle of fortnightly cuts. This means that the grass can be kept to the same standard as in our parks and open spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What residents can expect Grass verges are cut up to 15 times during the growing season usually between March and October, depending on weather conditions Cut grass should be removed from the pavement at the time the grass is cut Strimming takes place around benches, trees and other obstacles early in the growing season and then herbicide is applied around the base of trees and obstacles in April/May and again in September/October to prevent weed or grass growth Clippings will be left on the grass verge Where bulbs are planted, the grass will not be cut until the bulb foliage has died back and this is usually six to eight weeks after flowering Where wild flower planting has taken place, the grass will be left uncut for the duration of the season, normally until around late September to early October. All foliage will be removed from the site In periods of warm, wet weather grass may grow vigorously and following cutting the clippings are likely to clump and take longer to dissipate Where appropriate - and in consultation with residents - consideration will be given to promoting biodiversity with longer grass and wild flowers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unsuitable? Get updates Share Problems nearby UPDATES Yet again the grass cutting is not happening at the frequency specified by the County and local council of every 2 weeks, over 3 weeks since last cut!!!what are we paying council tax for, and is there an issue that the contractor cannot fulfill their obligation to the people that ultimately pay their wages. Please cut the grass.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 178, Saint Paul&#39;s Road, Wymans Brook, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5000927&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Double yellow lines barely visible, 16th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5000589</link>
<description>The double yellows that are on the corners of Saddlers Lane and Tivoli Walk are not very visible leading to cars parking and blocking the access to Sadlers Lane. There is a larger issue along that stretch of Tivoli Walk, too, whereby cars park on the pavement and then block access for wheelchairs and push chairs. Maybe there should be double yellow lines along the whole of one side of that street?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5000589.0.jpeg?240037d8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Saddlers Lane, Warden Hill, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5000589&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>5 Potholes at the junction with Suffolk Road and Montpellier Villas, 15th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4998443</link>
<description>Highways workmen arrived on Thursday 14 September to fill in the potholes. As can be seen from the photos only ONE pothole has been repaired. This is contrary to the Highways Customer Service Team who sent an email this morning stating that all of the five potholes had been repaired. This is clearly incorrect.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4998443.0.jpeg?68631a0d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 22, Montpellier Villas, Montpellier, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4998443&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Falling Tree obstructing the footpath/bridleway, 14th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4995392</link>
<description>This tree is very low across footpath/bridleway. It is in danger of falling completely and potentially causing injury to walkers or horse riders. I believe it has been been reported before directly to PROW department. To find it, from Brockhampton Lane end, take footpath, cross railway line, (CAREFULLY), then continue over first bridge. It is 30/40 metres from there&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/4995392.0.jpeg?a72af759&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockhampton Lane, Kingsditch, Bishop&#39;s Cleeve&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/4995392&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
