<title>Floodwater under bridge not clearing, 18th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595528</link>
<description>The road under the bridge often floods in heavy rain, though usually clears when the rain stops. It hasn’t rained all day though the flood water levels keep going up and down. I’d have expected it to clear by now though it’s still over a foot of floodwater. Can you please check if the drains need clearing? It may be a build up of silt.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5595528.0.jpeg?c5c598b6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Manor Lane, Gotherington, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595528&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Floods every day it rains!!!!!!, 18th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595435</link>
<description>The pavement and crossing outside 80 priors road floods everyday it rains, I have been reporting this for the last 12 years!!!! It’s now beyond a joke, eventually floods our house and we use flood defence!!! The depth it at times 3 inches. Last an intoxicated man tripped and fell into the water, luckily he wasn’t hurt but if he’d have hit his head he could have drowned!!! My two next door neighbours are 100% blind and they wade through it!!! Children and parents can’t use the crossing as it’s flooded, they instead walk along the road, I get complained at while trying to alleviate the issue!!! N have to put cones out. Like I said 12 years!! I have to get into the storm drain to clear it, the council did it once 3 years ago!!!! For the avoidance of doubt, I will be reporting this everyday now until some serious considerations are made, if by my 5th report hasn’t been answered and s I’m e type of consultation, I will be writing buy this is Glos and the MP - 12 years 12!!! A plan is really needed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5595435.0.jpeg?85dd1f5b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2, Burma Avenue, Lynworth, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595435&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Left lane uneven/subsiding - Westbound A40, 18th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595247</link>
<description>A40 Left-hand lane (lane 1) travelling westbound has become uneven and appearing to subside, with potholes appearing along join lines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is becoming unsafe to use this lane at speed (70mph) due to uneven surface. Vehicles are unable to manoeuvre around potholes when other traffic is in lane 2.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other traffic appears to avoid using this lane entirely to avoid the uneven surface, keeping right in lane 2 when they should be in lane 1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It would appear this lane needs resurfacing to bring it back up level and to remove the join lines that regularly introduce potholes.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): A40, Badgeworth, Tewkesbury&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595247&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road surface end of life, 18th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595073</link>
<description>This section of Gloucester Road is the worst condition road in Cheltenham by a some margin, and shocking for a main route used for traffic getting across town.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unsafe for cyclists and motorists alike, road users have to swerve all over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The surface is a mismatch of uneven backfills and potholes. It needs a new surface not more patching.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The various uneven surfaces that make this road up creates a noise nuisance for residents, damages vehicles, and prevents safe cycling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please resurface this road as a priority, and to the same standard as the recent resurfacing works on Princess Elizabeth Way and A40.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 163, Gloucester Road, Hatherley, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5595073&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
