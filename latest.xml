This is a very busy road and home to many people with children and young people using bicycles. Cars are driving dangerously trying to avoid the central damaged roads. It is an utter disgrace for this Festival town of Cheltenham, 23rd February</title>

<title>Light sensor is not detecting vehicles problem, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5619724</link>
<description>email rec 12/02/2024 - Hello&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please could the timings on the traffic lights at Princess Elizabeth Way in Cheltenham at the Kingsditch roundabout be reviewed. Coming from PE Way only about 6 cars progress on to the roundabout before the lights turn red again. It is causing significant tailbacks all the way down to Coronation Square and towards the A40. The timings seem to have changed after the resurfacing work on PE Way completed just over a week ago. &amp;#10;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5619724&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Long trench type pothole, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5619246</link>
<description>Located at junction of Sandford Road and College Lawn. Large trench pothole at junction is creating more gravel every day as it widens creating a hazard to motorists due to potential windscreen damage. This is also across the exit of Keynsham Road creating severe lurching of vehicles exiting on to Sandford Road. This is regularly used by the fire station vehicles. This pothole is adjacent to a pothole reported in December and now repaired.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/5619246.0.jpeg?9dbaadc1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sandford Road, Tivoli, Cheltenham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/5619246&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
